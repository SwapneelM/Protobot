 quote  I had played five years of firstclass cricket to break into the Indian team  scored a lot of runs in domestic cricket  were a few injuries and I was lucky to get the opportunity  knew that probably it would be the only one Otherwise I would have to go back to domestic cricket and start the cycle all over again  I remember when I was 50 not out at the end of the day  walking back to the hotel with Srinath and I knew somehow that this was probably a very significant innings I knew I had some more breathing space  a few more Test matches at least  gave me a lot of confidence scoring 95 here and 80 at Trent Bridge  as a player and as a person

Rise through the ranks
more citations neededsectiondateDecember 2017
Dravids poor form in Tests continued as India suffered a South African cricket team in India in 1999200002 whitewash against South Africa in a home series Tendulkar resigned from captaincy in March 2000 after the humiliating loss to South Africa amidst much speculations Sourav Ganguly the teams vicecaptain then was promoted as the new Indian team captain and Dravid was appointed as his deputy

The newly appointed vicecaptain had moderate success in the South African cricket team in India in 19992000ODIsbilateral ODI series against South Africa Dravid scored 208 runs in 5 matches at an average of 4160 including 2 fifties He also took 3 wickets in the series including two wickets in a single over in the First ODI at Kochi His bowling figures of 243 in 9 overs remained his career best ODI bowling figures It was also the best bowling figure by any bowler for that particular match His series bowling average of 2266 was the best amongst all the bowlers in the series India won the series 32

India played a 19992000 CocaCola Cuptrination series in Sharjah immediately after the bilateral ODI series against South Africa Indian team performed poorly and failed to qualify for the Finals Collective failure of Indian batting in the series can be judged from the fact that Dravid with a poor show of 89 runs from 4 matches at an average of 2225 was still the 2nd best Indian batsman in the series A week later a South Africa cricket match fixingmatch fixing scandal rocked the international cricket scene opening a Pandoras box that eventually engulfed top Indian and South African cricketers including Azharuddin and Cronje

County stint
Dravid had always been keen on further honing his batting skills in testing English conditions by playing in county cricket He had discussed regarding the same with John Wright former New Zealand cricketer and Kent coach during Indias 199899 tour of New Zealand Wright was particularly impressed with Dravids performance on that tour especially his twin hundreds at Hamilton The talks finally materialised when Dravid made his county debut for Kent in April 2000 Ganguly also debuted in the same match albeit for the opposite team

Kent offer had come as a welcome change for Dravid There was too much negativity surrounding Indian cricket marred by match fixing controversy Dravid himself was struggling to score runs Barring the one hundred against New Zealand at Mohali Dravid had not played a significant inning throughout the 199900 season The county stint gave him a chance to get away to a new environment and relax The wide variety of pitches and weather conditions in England and a full season of intense county cricket against professional cricketers gave him a chance to further his cricketing education and learn things about his game

Dravid made the most of this opportunity In his 2nd game for Kent Dravid scored a fluid 182 propelling them to an innings and 163 runs victory over the touring Zimbabwe side Out of 7 first class tour games that Zimbabwe played on that tour Kent was the only team that managed to beat them Dravid hit another fifty in a draw against Surrey In June 2000 Dravid had to miss a county match for Kent in order to perform his national duties

Indian team not in right frame of mind expectedly performed poorly in the Asia cup 2000 Dravids poor form much like throughout the 199900 season continued in Asia cup however he showed no signs of it when he returned to England to resume his Kent duties He continued his sublime form in county cricket

In July 2000 Kents away match against Hampshire at Portsmouth was billed as a showdown between two great cricketers Warne and Dravid Dravid came out on top On a dustbowl tailor made to suit home team spinners Warne took 4 wickets but could not take the all important wicket of Dravid Coming in to bat at 152 Dravid faced 295 balls scoring 137 runs  his maiden hundred in county championships Dravid scored 73 not out in the 2nd innings guiding Kent to a six wicket victory as Warne went wicketless

In their last county game of the season Kent needed one bonus point to prevent themselves from being relegated to the Second Division Dravid made sure they stay put in the First Division by fetching that one bonus point with an inning of 77 runs

Dravid concluded a successful stint with Kent aggregating 1221 runs from 16 first class matches15 county games and 1 tour game against Zimbabwe at an average of 5550 including 2 hundreds and 8 fifties He shouldered Kents batting singlehandedly as the second best Kent batsman during the same period Paul Nixon scored just 567 runs at an average of 3335 in 17 matches Dravid contributed to Kents county campaign not just with the bat but also with his fielding and bowling taking 14 catches and 4 wickets at an average of 3200

Golden years
As the new international season commenced the first and foremost challenge for the newly appointed captain and vicecaptain Ganguly and Dravid was to pull the team out of the shadows of the match fixing scandal Indian team played 2000 ICC Knockout Trophy with vigour and showed a lot of character beating Kenya Australia and South Africa in consecutive matches to reach the Finals Although India lost to New Zealand in the Finals their spirited performance in the tournament helped restoring public faith back in Indian cricket Dravid played his part scoring 157 runs in 4 matches at an average of 5233 including 2 fifties Dravid played the first two matches of 200001 CocaCola Champions Trophy and scored 85 runs in the 2nd match against Zimbabwe opening the innings before getting injured while fielding at slips forcing him to miss the rest of the tournament

India started off the new Test season with a 9wicket win against Bangladesh Dravid played a brisk inning of 49 ball 41 runs including 5 fours and a six chasing a target of 63 runs However Dravids poor patch truly ended in the next Test series against Zimbabwe which was also the first series for John Wright as the new Indian coach Wright was instrumental in Dravids association with Kent earlier this year Dravid returned the favour by recommending his name to the BCCI for the post of national team coach  By now Dravid had played 8 Tests since his last hundred against New Zealand at Mohali scoring just 350 runs at a paltry average of 2333 without a single fifty plus inning The Indian vicecaptain ended the run drought and welcomed the new Indian coach with a double hundred  Dravids first He scored 200 not out in the first inning and 70 not out in the second inning guiding India to a comfortable 9wicket victory against Zimbabwe He scored 162 in the drawn Second test to end the series with an average of 43200  highest batting average by an Indian in a Test series

Australia tour of India 200001
The Australian team toured India in February 2001 for 3 tests and 5 ODIs The tour was billed as the Final Frontier for Steve Waughs all conquering men who came to India on the back of 15 consecutive Test wins The Australian team extended their run to 16 consecutive wins as they beat India convincingly in the first test by 10 wickets Dravid scored 9 in the first innings as India folded for 176 runs In the second innings Dravid along with Tendulkar tried to show some resistance At one point Dravid mistimed a pull that Slater claimed to have caught cleanly However the third umpire thought otherwise Dravid stood ground Slater in a moment of madness as described by Peter Roebuck had an altercation with Dravid and onfield umpires Dravids 196 ball long resistance finally ended when he got out bowled to Warne for 39 runs

History at Eden
The Australian juggernaut seemed unstoppable as they looked on course for their 17th consecutive victory in the second test at the Eden Gardens Australia amassed 445 runs in the first innings after winning the toss and electing to bat first In reply Indian team was bowled out for meagre 171 conceding a lead of 274 runs Dravid scored 25 runs from 82 balls and eventually got out bowled to Warne for the 2nd time in a row Only Laxman scored more than Dravid in the innings India was expectedly asked to followon by Steve Waugh Laxman who had scored a fine fifty in the first innings was promoted to no 3 position which had been Dravids usual spot for quite sometime now while Dravid who was not looking in best of form in the series was relegated to no 6 position Although Indian batting displayed better show in the second innings they were still looking towards a certain defeat Dravid came out to bat at no 6 with scoreboard reading 2324 with India still needing 42 runs to avoid an innings defeat Dravid joined forces with the man who had replaced him at no 3 position as they played out the remaining time avoiding any further jolts India ended the days play at 2544 with Laxman unbeaten at 109 and Dravid at 7

As the fourth days play started with India still 20 runs behind with just 6 wickets in hand and two full days of play left another convincing win for Australia looked inevitable However what transpired on Day 4 etched the names of Laxman and Dravid in history forever Laxman and Dravid batted out the entire day without getting dismissed Steve Waugh used 9 bowlers but Laxman and Dravid kept McGrathWarne and company at bay and scored at will completely dominating the bowling Indias score which was 2544 at the start of the days play read 5894 at the end of the days play The duo added 335 runs on day 4 tumbling many records on the way Dravid having been under severe criticism for his previous failures in the series celebrated his hundred in an uncharacteristic fashion gesturing at the press box He remained unbeaten at 155 and Laxman at 276 at the end of the days play

Laxman could add only 5 runs to his tally on Day 5 missing on a landmark triple hundred thus bringing an end to a historic 375run partnership However Dravid continued in the same vein before getting run out for 180 while trying to force the pace Captain Ganguly allowed the tail to score some quick runs before declaring at 6577 setting Australia a target of 384 with 75 overs left in the match The partnership between Dravid and Laxman had not pulled India back in the match but also instilled a sense of selfbelief in the team An inspired team India bowled superbly to dismiss Australia for 212 in 683 overs India won the match by 171 runs becoming only the 2nd team to do so after following on

Dravid scored 81 runs in the first innings of the third test and took 4 catches in the match as India defeated Australia at Chennai in a nail biting finish to clinch the series 21 Although Dravid did exceptionally well in the series scoring 338 runs at an average of 5633 the series cost him the coveted no 3 position in the Indian batting lineup Dravid scored 80 in the first of the 5 match ODI series at his home ground as India won the match by 60 runs He didnt do too well in the remaining 4 ODIs as Australia won the series 32

Between April 2001 and March 2002 India played 12 official tests including 2 each in Zimbabwe and South Africa3rd test being declared unofficial 3 in Sri Lanka and a 3match and 2match home series against England and Zimbabwe respectively Dravid performed below par scoring 669 runs from 12 tests at an average of 3935 including 6 fifties He looked in good touch in Zimbabwe as he scored 137 runs from 134 balls in the first tour game However he could score just a solitary fifty in the test series as the series ended in a 11 draw He aggregated 138 runs at an average of 6900 from the series During Sri Lanka tour Dravid moved up the order in the absence of injured Tendulkar and Laxman He batted at no 4 in the first test and at his favourite no 3 position in the remaining two tests Batting at no 3 Dravid scored crucial 75 runs in the 4th innings of the 2nd test as India defeated Sri Lanka by 7 wickets chasing a target of 264 runs He ended up as the highest scorer for India in the series with 235 runs at an average of 4700 including 2 fifties India lost the series 12 On the South African tour Dravid opened the innings in the first test but failed to make a mark as India lost the match In the 2nd test India was set a target of 395 runs with a full day plus 41 overs of play left in the match India having failed to survive for 100 overs in any of the previous 3 innings in the series started on a poor note losing their first wicket in the first over with zero runs on the scoreboard However Dravid forged an important partnership of 171 runs with Dasgupta More importantly the partnership lasted for 832 overs taking India to the brink of safety Poor weather too helped India salvage a draw as only 962 overs could be bowled in the innings However the match is best known for the Mike Denness incident The match referee handed a one match ban to Sehwag and suspended ban to five other Indian players including Tendulkar and Ganguly for various offences including excessive appealing and ball tampering The BCCI threatened to call off the tour if Mike Denness continued as the referee While ICC sided with Denness South African board sided with BCCI replacing Denness and forcing ICC to declare the 3rd test unofficial Dravid captained the team in the unofficial test in the absence of injured Ganguly India lost the match by an innings margin Except for the match saving innings of 87 runs at Port Elizabeth Dravid failed miserably in the series bringing his series aggregate to 130 runs from 3 tests2 official and one unofficial at an average of 2166 Dravid performed poorly in the subsequent home series against England and Zimbabwe scoring just two fifties in 5 tests

Dravid compensated for the below par performance in tests in 200102 season with a good show in the ODIs On the tour to Zimbabwe he scored an unbeaten 72 off 64 balls while chasing a target of 235 against Zimbabwe in the 3rd match of the triseries guiding India to a 4wicket win with 4 balls to spare He was adjudged man of the match for his match winning knock He ended up with a series aggregate of 121 runs from 5 matches at a decent average of 4033 and a strike rate of 10168 He was the only batsman with a strike rate of more than 100 among those who managed to aggregate more than 100 runs in the series In the triangular series in Sri Lanka India lost 3 consecutive matches and was on the brink elimination from the series In the absence of injured Tendulkar and Zaheer and suspended Ganguly Dravid captained the side in the 4th match and led them to their first win in the series He played crucial innings in the last three league matches contributing to three consecutive victories thus helping India qualify for the Finals which they eventually lost to Sri Lanka Dravid topped Indias run chart for the series scoring 259 runs at an average of 5180 and a strike rate of 5981 Dravid followed it up with another decent show in Standard Bank triseries in South Africa scoring 214 runs at an average of 5350 and a strike rate of 7181 including 3 fifties He also kept wickets in the final two ODIs including the Final of the series effecting 3 stumpings By the end of the South African tour Dravid had started experiencing problem in his right shoulder Although he played the ensuing home test series against England he pulled out of the 5match ODI series against England to undergo shoulder rehabilitation programme in South Africa He returned for the home series against Zimbabwe and had a forgettable outing in the ODI series barring the one inning of 66 not out from 59 balls in the 2nd match

India toured West Indies in April 2002 Dravid scored an unbeaten hundred his tenth overall and 6th outside India against West Indies at Georgetown in the first test match Batting with a swollen jaw after being hit by a Mervyn Dillon bouncer Dravid scored 144 not out saving the day for India as they avoided a followon The match ended in a draw India beat West Indies by 37 runs in the second test at Port of Spain Dravid contributed to the win with a fifty and 4 catches He scored 91 runs in the 4th drawn test at St Johns He also took the wicket of Ridley Jacobs who was batting on 118  Dravids only wicket in Test cricket India lost the 5match test series 12 Dravid was the 2nd highest scorer for India aggregating 404 runs at an average of 5771 He fared poorly with the bat in the bilateral ODI series He also doubled up as the wicketkeeper in the series effecting 2 dismissals 1 catch and 1 stumping

India tour of England 2002
Indias next international assignment was the England tour in June 2002 6 years after the previous tour when Dravid had made his Test debut It was this tour where Dravid hit the peak form of his career The tour started with a triangular ODI series involving India England and Sri Lanka Dravid continued his keeping job in the series In the first ODI at Lords Dravid effected 3 dismissals 2 catches and 1 stumping and then scored an unbeaten 73 runs guiding India to a 6wicket victory against England in the company of Yuvraj Singh In the 4th ODI against Sri Lanka Dravid effected 1 dismissal 1 catch and scored a fifty that won him a man of the match award as India won the match by 4 wickets India eventually pulled off a remarkable chase to win the tournament beating England in the Finals by 2 wickets Dravid scored 245 runs including 3 fifties at an average of 4900 third highest for India in the series He also effected 9 dismissals including 6 catches an 3 stumpings most by a keeper in the series

Dravid warmed up for the 4match Test series with a fifty against Hampshire in the tour game He scored 46 and 63 in the First Test at Lords as India lost the match by 170 runs He failed in the first innings of the Second Test at Nottingham as India scored 357 runs England riding on Vaughns hundred piled up a mammoth 617 runs taking a first innings lead of 260 runs Indian team was in a state of bother as they were reduced to 112 in the second innings still trailing by 249 runs however a match saving hundred by Dravid along with fifties from Tendulkar and Ganguly enabled India to draw the match

The third test of the series was played at Headingley traditionally known to be conducive for seam bowling Ganguly won the toss and took a bold decision to bat first on a gloomy overcast morning Naseer Hussain had studded his bowling lineup with four seamers including Hoggard Flintoff Tudor and Caddick To make the matters worse India lost Sehwag in the seventh over of the match However Dravid came in and joined forces with Bangar Together the two batsmen weathered the storm They applied themselves took body blows but never gave the English bowlers any chance Dravid and Bangar starred in a match defining partnership of 170 runs By the time Bangar got out after a commendable fifty the sun was out and batting had become easier Tendulkar joined Dravid as Dravid went on to complete his 12th Test hundred Dravid and Tendulkar put on 150 runs together before a battered and bruised Dravid finally got out stumped to Giles for 148 runs but not before playing out the difficult morning session of the second day As the conditions got easier to bat Ganguly and Tendulkar piled on Englands misery bringing up their individual hundreds in the process India declared the innings on 6288 and then bowled England out twice to win the match by an innings and 46 runs  Indias first overseas victory by an innings margin since 197778 Such was the impact of Dravids sevenhourlong fighting knock that despite Sachin outscoring him by 45 runs he scored 193 runs Dravid was adjudged the man of the match for his 148 runs Dravid backed up his two consecutive hundreds in the series with another one at The Oval this time scoring a double hundred After England scored 515 runs in the first innings of the fourth Test Dravid scored 217 runs to take India to 505 The test and the series ended in a draw Dravid was adjudged man of the match for second consecutive match Dravid amassed 602 runs in the series at an average of 10033 including three hundreds and a fifty and was adjudged joint man of the series along with Vaughan

Dravid became the first Indian batsman to score hundreds in four consecutive Test innings when he scored 100 not out against West Indies in the first of the three match home series at Wankhede Severe cramps and dehydration forced Dravid to leave his inning midway soon after he completed his hundred as he retired hurt on 100 to get drips administered to himself India won the test by innings and 112 runs Dravid didnt do too well in the remaining two tests ending with a modest series aggregate of 148 runs at an average of 4933 Dravid did well in the subsequent bilateral 7match ODI series He topped Indian averages for the series scoring 300 runs at an average of 75 and a strike rate of 8982 including one hundred and two fifties He also effected 7 dismissals 6 catches 1 stumping  most by a wicketkeeper in the series In the 4th ODI West Indies set India an improbable target of 325 runs to win the match Dravid scored a solid hundred and forged an unbeaten partnership with Bangar as India won the match by 5 wickets levelling the series 22 He once again scored an important fifty in the 6th match when India were down in the series 23 helping India win the match and level the series 33 India however lost the last match to lose the series 34

Indias preparation for 2003 World Cup didnt go as well as theyd have hoped for Their last overseas tour before the World Cup turned out to be a disaster Indians suffered a whitewash in the 2 match Test series in New Zealand and lost the ODI series 25 Although Dravid top scored for India in the Test series and was the 3rd best batsman for India in the ODIs his performances were far from satisfactory

2003 Cricket World Cup
He was appointed the vicecaptain during 2003 World Cup in which India reached the finals playing as a wicketkeeper batsman to accommodate an additional batsman a strategy that worked out well Dravid was appointed the captain for the Indian team for 2007 Cricket World Cup2007 World Cup where India had an unsuccessful campaign

Playing style
Dravid is known for his technique and had been one of the best batsmen for the Indian cricket team In the beginning he was known as a defensive batsman who should be confined to Test cricket and was dropped from the ODI squad due to a low strike rate However in a period of his career he began consistently scoring runs in ODIs as well earning him the ICC Player of the year award His nickname of The Wall in Reebok advertisements is now used as his nickname Dravid has scored 36 centuries in Test cricket at an average of 5319 this included five double centuries In onedayers he has an average of 3949 and a strike rate of 7122 He is one of the few Indians whose Test average is better at away than at home averaging almost five runs more in foreign pitchesref nameRDhttpwwwhowstatcomcricketstatisticsPlayersPlayerHomeAwayaspPlayerID2060 Rahul Dravid Analysis of Performances at Home and Away webarchiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20091124111702httpwwwhowstatcomcricketStatisticsPlayersPlayerHomeAwayaspPlayerID2060 date24 November 2009  Retrieved 23 November 2010ref As of 23 September 2010 Dravids Test average in abroad is 5553 and his Test average at home is 5076ref nameRD  his ODI average abroad is 3793refcite web urlhttpstatsespncricinfocomciengineplayer28114htmlclass2homeoraway2homeoraway3spanmax123Sep2010spanval1spantemplateresultstypeallround titleRahul Dravid away batting stats in ODI accessdate23 November 2010ref and his ODI average at home is 4311refcite web urlhttpwwwhowstatcomcricketstatisticsPlayersPlayerCountriesODIaspPlayerID2060 titleRahul Dravid home batting stats in ODI accessdate23 November 2010 deadurlno archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20130807123501httpwwwhowstatcomcricketstatisticsPlayersPlayerCountriesODIaspPlayerID2060 archivedate7 August 2013 dfref Taking those matches in consideration that were won by India Dravid averages 6634 runs in Testsrefcite web urlhttpstatsespncricinfocomciengineplayer28114htmlclass1result1spanmax123Sep2010spanval1spantemplateresultstypeallround titleRahul Dravid Test analysis in matches won accessdate23 November 2010ref and 5069 runs in ODIsrefcite web urlhttpstatsespncricinfocomciengineplayer28114htmlclass2result1spanmax123Sep2010spanval1spantemplateresultstypeallround titleRahul Dravid ODI analysis in matches won accessdate23 November 2010ref

Dravids sole Test wicket was of Ridley Jacobs in the fourth Test match against the West Indies during the 20012002 series While he has no pretensions to being a bowler Dravid often kept wicket for India in ODIs Dravid is now a specialist batsman averaging 6351 in matches played since 1 January 2000

Dravid was involved in two of the largest partnerships in ODIs a 318run partnership with Sourav Ganguly the first pair to combine for a 300run partnership and then a 331run partnership with Sachin Tendulkar which is a world record He also holds the record for the greatest number of innings played since debut before being dismissed for a duck His highest scores in ODIs and Tests are 153 and 270 respectively Each of his five double centuries in Tests was a higher score than his previous double century 200 217 222 233 270

Also Dravid is the current world record holder for the highest percentage of runs scored in matches won under a single captain where the captain has won more than 20 Testsref nameautogenerated1cite web urlhttpcontentusacricinfocomcolumnscontentstory221152html titleCricinfo  The Man Fridays publisherContentusacricinfocom accessdate20 December 2010 deadurlno archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20070123113220httpcontentusacricinfocomcolumnscontentstory221152html archivedate23 January 2007 dfref In the 21 Test matches India won under Gangulys captaincy Dravid scored at a record average of 10284 runs scoring 2571 runs with nine hundreds three of them being doublecenturies and ten fifties in 32 innings He contributed nearly 23 of the total runs scored by India in those 21 matches which is almost one run out of every four runs the team scored

He was named one of the Wisden cricketers of the year in 2000 Though primarily a defensive batsman Dravid scored 50 runs not out in 22 balls a strike rate of 22727 against New Zealand in Hyderabad on 15 November 2003 the second fastest 50 among Indian batsmen Only Ajit Agarkars 67 runs off 21 balls is faster than that of Dravid

In 2006 it was announced that he would remain captain of the Indian team up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup2007 World Cup in the West Indies

However after the series against England he stepped down as the Indian captain due to personal reasons MS Dhoni took over as ODI captain whereas Anil Kumble replaced him in test matches

In 2008 he made 93 runs in the first innings of the Perth test the highest score of the match to help India win and make the series 12 However he was ignored by selectors for the subsequent oneday triseries

After a barren run in Test matches in 2008 Dravid came under increasing media pressure to retire or be dropped In the Second Test against England in Mohali he scored 136 runs putting on a triplecentury stand with Gautam Gambhir

After reaching 10000 test runs milestone he saidIts a proud moment for sure For me growing up I dreamt of playing for India When I look back I probably exceeded my expectations with what I have done over the last 10 to 12 years I never had an ambition to do it because I never believed  it is just a reflection of my longevity in the gamerefcite news urlhttpnewsbbccouksport2hicricket7320087stm titleDravid reaches Test runs landmark publisherBBC News date29 March 2008 accessdate20 December 2010 deadurlno archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20120326042657httpnewsbbccouksport2hicricket7320087stm archivedate26 March 2012 dfref

Captaincy
Rahul Dravid has had a mixed record when leading India in Tests

One of Dravids most debated decisions was taken in March 2004 when he was standing in as the captain for injured Sourav Ganguly Indias first innings was declared at a point when Sachin Tendulkar was at 194 runs not out with 16 overs remaining on Day 2In this test match Sehwag scored triple century first time He became the first Indian to score triple century in test with a score of 309refcite news urlhttpwwwhinducom20040430stories2004043000932100htm locationChennai India workThe Hindu titleMultan declaration was a mistake Ganguly date30 April 2004 deadurlno archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20050901043946httpwwwhinducom20040430stories2004043000932100htm archivedate1 September 2005 dfref

In March 2006 India lost the Mumbai Test giving England its first Test victory in India since 1985 enabling it to draw the series 11 The defeat in Mumbai was arguably the result of Dravids decision to bowl first on a flat dry pitch which later deteriorated and ended with an Indian collapse in the run chase Coincidentally it was Dravids 100th test match in which the Indians were all out for 100 runs in the second innings

After India failed to qualify for the final of the 200607 DLF CupDLF Cup Dravid the skipper was criticised by former allrounder Ravi Shastri who said that he was not assertive enough and let Greg Chappell make too many decisionsrefcite news urlhttpwwwhinducom20060925stories2006092509681900htm locationChennai India workThe Hindu titleShastri criticises Dravid date25 September 2006 deadurlno archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20071019200036httphinducom20060925stories2006092509681900htm archivedate19 October 2007 dfref When asked for a response Dravid said that Shastri while a fair critic was not privy to the internal decisionmaking process of the teamrefcite web urlhttpwwwzeenewscomznnewarticlesaspaid328034ssid88sidSPO titlePathans destiny is in his own hands Dravid publisherZee News date9 October 2006 accessdate20 December 2010 archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20070930205601httpwwwzeenewscomznnewarticlesaspaid328034ssid88sidSPO archivedate30 September 2007 deadurlyesref
