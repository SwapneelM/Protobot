Hawking also maintained his public profile including bringing science to a wider audience A film version of A Brief History of Time directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg premiered in 1992 Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical but he was persuaded otherwise The film while a critical success was not widely releasedsfnFerguson2011pp16870 A popularlevel collection of essays interviews and talks titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993sfnFerguson2011p178 and a sixpart television series Stephen Hawkings Universe and a companion book appeared in 1997 As Hawking insisted this time the focus was entirely on sciencesfnFerguson2011p189sfnLarsen2005p97

 Disability 
Hawking had a rare earlyonset slowprogressing form of motor neurone disease also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease that gradually paralysed him over the decadesref name0

quoteHawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities Using similar techniques Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes that stationary solutions of Einsteins equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes the total surface area of the event horizons must increase In collaboration with G Ellis Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on Spacetime in the Large
