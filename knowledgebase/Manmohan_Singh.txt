In a 2005 interview with the British journalist Mark Tully Singh said about his Cambridge days blockquote
At Cambridge university I first became conscious of the creative role of politics in shaping human affairs and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students in a manner that very few others were able to achieve She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes maintaining that the state has to play more of a role if you really want to combine development with social equity Kaldor influenced me even more I found him pragmatic scintillating stimulating Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to workblockquote
