Artificial neural networks ANNs or Connectionismconnectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brainsrefCite weburlhttpswwwfrontiersinorgresearchtopics4817artificialneuralnetworksasmodelsofneuralinformationprocessingtitleArtificial Neural Networks as Models of Neural Information Processing  Frontiers Research Topiclanguageenaccessdate20180220ref Such systems learn ie progressively improve performance on tasks by considering examples generally without taskspecific programming For example in image recognition they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually Labeled datalabeled as cat or no cat and using the results to identify cats in other images They do this without any a priori knowledgea priori knowledge about cats eg that they have fur tails whiskers and catlike faces Instead they evolve their own set of relevant characteristics from the learning material that they process

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons a simplified version of biological neurons in an animal brain Each connection a simplified version of a synapse between artificial neurons can transmit a signal from one to another The artificial neuron that receives the signal can process it and then signal artificial neurons connected to it

In common ANN implementations the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number and the output of each artificial neuron is calculated by a nonlinear function of the sum of its inputs Artificial neurons and connections typically have a weight mathematicsweight that adjusts as learning proceeds The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold is the signal sent Typically artificial neurons are organized in layers Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs Signals travel from the first input to the last output layer possibly after traversing the layers multiple times

The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would However over time attention focused on matching specific tasks leading to deviations from biology ANNs have been used on a variety of tasks including computer vision speech recognition machine translation social network filtering playing Board gameboard and video games and medical diagnosis

Support vector machines and other much simpler methods such as linear classifiers gradually overtook neural networks in machine learning popularity

Earlier challenges in training deep neural networks were successfully addressed with methods such as unsupervised pretraining while available computing power increased through the use of GPUs and distributed computing Neural networks were deployed on a large scale particularly in image and visual recognition problems This became known as deep learning

An artificial neural network is a network of simple elements called Artificial neuronneurons which receive input change their internal state activation according to that input and produce output depending on the input and activation The network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a Directed graphdirected weighted graph The weights as well as the Activation functionfunctions that compute the activation can be modified by a process called learning which is governed by a learning ruleref nameZell1994ch52cite book lastZell firstAndreas year1994 titleSimulation Neuronaler Netze transtitleSimulation of Neural Networks languageGerman edition1st publisherAddisonWesley  chapterchapter 52 isbn3893195548ref

Components of an artificial neural network

Neurons
A neuron with label mathjmath receiving an input mathpjtmath from predecessor neurons consists of the following componentsref nameZell1994ch52 

 an activation mathajtmath depending on a discrete time parameter
 possibly a threshold maththetajmath which stays fixed unless changed by a learning function
 an activation function mathfmath that computes the new activation at a given time matht1math from mathajtmath maththetajmath and the net input mathpjtmath giving rise to the relation
 math ajt1  fajt pjt thetaj math
 and an output function mathfoutmath computing the output from the activation
 math ojt  foutajt math
Often the output function is simply the Identity function

An input neuron has no predecessor but serves as input interface for the whole network Similarly an output neuron has no successor and thus serves as output interface of the whole network

Connections and weights
The network consists of connections each connection transferring the output of a neuron mathimath to the input of a neuron mathjmath In this sense mathimath is the predecessor of mathjmath and mathjmath is the successor of mathimath Each connection is assigned a weight mathwijmathref nameZell1994ch52 

Propagation function
The propagation function computes the input mathpjtmath to the neuron mathjmath from the outputs mathoitmath of predecessor neurons and typically has the formref nameZell1994ch52 
 math pjt  sumi oit wij math

Learning rule
The learning rule is a rule or an algorithm which modifies the parameters of the neural network in order for a given input to the network to produce a favored output This learning process typically amounts to modifying the weights and thresholds of the variables within the networkref nameZell1994ch52 

Neural networks as functions
See alsoGraphical models

Neural network models can be viewed as simple mathematical models defining a function mathtextstyle  f  X rightarrow Y math or a distribution over mathtextstyle Xmath or both mathtextstyle Xmath and mathtextstyle Ymath Sometimes models are intimately associated with a particular learning rule A common use of the phrase ANN model is really the definition of a class of such functions where members of the class are obtained by varying parameters connection weights or specifics of the architecture such as the number of neurons or their connectivity

Mathematically a neurons network function mathtextstyle fxmath is defined as a composition of other functions mathtextstyle gixmath that can further be decomposed into other functions This can be conveniently represented as a network structure with arrows depicting the dependencies between functions A widely used type of composition is the nonlinear weighted sum where mathtextstyle f x  K leftsumi wi gixright math where mathtextstyle Kmath commonly referred to as the activation functionrefcite weburlhttpwwwcseunsweduaubillwmldicthtmlactivnfntitleThe Machine Learning Dictionaryref is some predefined function such as the hyperbolic functionStandard analytic expressionshyperbolic tangent or sigmoid function or softmax function or ReLUrectifier function The important characteristic of the activation function is that it provides a smooth transition as input values change ie a small change in input produces a small change in output The following refers to a collection of functions mathtextstyle gimath as a Vector mathematics and physicsvector mathtextstyle g  g1 g2 ldots gnmath

FileAnn dependency graphsvgthumb150pxANN dependency graph

This figure depicts such a decomposition of mathtextstyle fmath with dependencies between variables indicated by arrows These can be interpreted in two ways

The first view is the functional view the input mathtextstyle xmath is transformed into a 3dimensional vector mathtextstyle hmath which is then transformed into a 2dimensional vector mathtextstyle gmath which is finally transformed into mathtextstyle fmath This view is most commonly encountered in the context of Mathematical optimizationoptimization

The second view is the probabilistic view the random variable mathtextstyle F  fG math depends upon the random variable mathtextstyle G  gHmath which depends upon mathtextstyle HhXmath which depends upon the random variable mathtextstyle Xmath This view is most commonly encountered in the context of graphical models

The two views are largely equivalent In either case for this particular architecture the components of individual layers are independent of each other eg the components of mathtextstyle gmath are independent of each other given their input mathtextstyle hmath This naturally enables a degree of parallelism in the implementation

FileRecurrent ann dependency graphpngthumb120px Two separate depictions of the recurrent ANN dependency graph

Networks such as the previous one are commonly called feedforward neural networkfeedforward because their graph is a directed acyclic graph Networks with Cycle graph theorycycles are commonly called Recurrent neural networkrecurrent Such networks are commonly depicted in the manner shown at the top of the figure where mathtextstyle fmath is shown as being dependent upon itself However an implied temporal dependence is not shown

Learning
See alsoMathematical optimizationEstimation theoryMachine learning

The possibility of learning has attracted the most interest in neural networks Given a specific task to solve and a class of functions mathtextstyle Fmath learning means using a set of observations to find mathtextstyle  f in Fmath which solves the task in some optimal sense

This entails defining a cost function mathtextstyle C  F rightarrow mathbbRmath such that for the optimal solution mathtextstyle fmath mathtextstyle Cf leq Cfmath mathtextstyle forall f in Fmathsnd ie no solution has a cost less than the cost of the optimal solution see mathematical optimization

The cost function mathtextstyle Cmath is an important concept in learning as it is a measure of how far away a particular solution is from an optimal solution to the problem to be solved Learning algorithms search through the solution space to find a function that has the smallest possible cost

For applications where the solution is data dependent the cost must necessarily be a function of the observations otherwise the model would not relate to the data It is frequently defined as a statistic to which only approximations can be made As a simple example consider the problem of finding the model mathtextstyle fmath which minimizes mathtextstyle CEleftfx  y2rightmath for data pairs mathtextstyle xymath drawn from some distribution mathtextstyle mathcalDmath In practical situations we would only have mathtextstyle Nmath samples from mathtextstyle mathcalDmath and thus for the above example we would only minimize mathtextstyle hatCfrac1Nsumi1N fxiyi2math Thus the cost is minimized over a sample of the data rather than the entire distribution

When mathtextstyle N rightarrow inftymath some form of online machine learning must be used where the cost is reduced as each new example is seen While online machine learning is often used when mathtextstyle mathcalDmath is fixed it is most useful in the case where the distribution changes slowly over time In neural network methods some form of online machine learning is frequently used for finite datasets

Choosing a cost function
While it is possible to define an ad hoc cost function frequently a particular cost function is used either because it has desirable properties such as Convex functionconvexity or because it arises naturally from a particular formulation of the problem eg in a probabilistic formulation the posterior probability of the model can be used as an inverse cost Ultimately the cost function depends on the task

The weight updates of backpropagation can be done via stochastic gradient descent using the following equation
 math wijt  1  wijt  etafracpartial Cpartial wij xit math
where math eta math is the learning rate math C math is the cost loss function and mathxitmath a stochastic term The choice of the cost function depends on factors such as the learning type supervised unsupervised Reinforcement learningreinforcement etc and the activation function For example when performing supervised learning on a multiclass classification problem common choices for the activation function and cost function are the Softmax activation functionsoftmax function and cross entropy function respectively The softmax function is defined as math pj  fracexpxjsumk expxk math where math pj math represents the class probability output of the unit math j math and math xj math and math xk math represent the total input to units math j math and math k math of the same level respectively Cross entropy is defined as math C  sumj dj logpj math where math dj math represents the target probability for output unit math j math and math pj math is the probability output for math j math after applying the activation functionrefCite journallastHintonfirstGlast2Dengfirst2Llast3Yufirst3Dlast4Dahlfirst4G Elast5Mohamedfirst5A rlast6Jaitlyfirst6Nlast7Seniorfirst7Alast8Vanhouckefirst8Vlast9Nguyenfirst9PdateNovember 2012titleDeep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition The Shared Views of Four Research Groupsurlhttpieeexploreieeeorgdocument6296526journalIEEE Signal Processing Magazinevolume29issue6pages8297doi101109msp20122205597issn10535888bibcode2012ISPM2982Href

Learning paradigms
The three major learning paradigms each correspond to a particular learning task These are supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning

 Supervised learning 
Supervised learning uses a set of example pairs math x y x in X y in Ymath and the aim is to find a function math  f  X rightarrow Y math in the allowed class of functions that matches the examples In other words we wish to infer the mapping implied by the data the cost function is related to the mismatch between our mapping and the data and it implicitly contains prior knowledge about the problem domainrefCite journallastOjhafirstVarun Kumarlast2Abrahamfirst2Ajithlast3Snášelfirst3Václavdate20170401titleMetaheuristic design of feedforward neural networks A review of two decades of researchurlhttpwwwsciencedirectcomsciencearticlepiiS0952197617300234journalEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligencevolume60pages97116doi101016jengappai201701013ref

A commonly used cost is the meansquared error which tries to minimize the average squared error between the networks output math fxmath and the target value math ymath over all the example pairs Minimizing this cost using gradient descent for the class of neural networks called multilayer perceptrons MLP produces the Backpropagationbackpropagation algorithm for training neural networks

Tasks that fall within the paradigm of supervised learning are pattern recognition also known as classification and Regression analysisregression also known as function approximation The supervised learning paradigm is also applicable to sequential data eg for hand writing speech and gesture recognition This can be thought of as learning with a teacher in the form of a function that provides continuous feedback on the quality of solutions obtained thus far

Unsupervised learning
In unsupervised learning some data mathtextstyle xmath is given and the cost function to be minimized that can be any function of the data mathtextstyle xmath and the networks output mathtextstyle fmath

The cost function is dependent on the task the model domain and any A priori and a posterioria priori assumptions the implicit properties of the model its parameters and the observed variables

As a trivial example consider the model mathtextstyle fx  amath where mathtextstyle amath is a constant and the cost mathtextstyle CEx  fx2math Minimizing this cost produces a value of mathtextstyle amath that is equal to the mean of the data The cost function can be much more complicated Its form depends on the application for example in Data compressioncompression it could be related to the mutual information between mathtextstyle xmath and mathtextstyle fxmath whereas in statistical modeling it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized

Tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general Approximationestimation problems the applications include Data clusteringclustering the estimation of statistical distributions Data compressioncompression and Bayesian spam filteringfiltering

Reinforcement learning
See alsoStochastic control

In reinforcement learning data mathtextstyle xmath are usually not given but generated by an agents interactions with the environment At each point in time mathtextstyle tmath the agent performs an action mathtextstyle ytmath and the environment generates an observation mathtextstyle xtmath and an instantaneous cost mathtextstyle ctmath according to some usually unknown dynamics The aim is to discover a policy for selecting actions that minimizes some measure of a longterm cost eg the expected cumulative cost The environments dynamics and the longterm cost for each policy are usually unknown but can be estimated

More formally the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process MDP with states mathtextstyle s1snin S math and actions mathtextstyle a1am in Amath with the following probability distributions the instantaneous cost distribution mathtextstyle Pctstmath the observation distribution mathtextstyle Pxtstmath and the transition mathtextstyle Pst1st atmath while a policy is defined as the conditional distribution over actions given the observations Taken together the two then define a Markov chain MC The aim is to discover the policy ie the MC that minimizes the cost

Training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models or in a Bayesian probabilityBayesian framework determining a distribution over the set of allowed models that minimizes the cost Numerous algorithms are available for training neural network models most of them can be viewed as a straightforward application of Mathematical optimizationoptimization theory and statistical estimation

Most employ some form of gradient descent using backpropagation to compute the actual gradients This is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradientrelated direction Backpropagation training algorithms fall into three categories

 Stacked denoising autoencoders 
The auto encoder idea is motivated by the concept of a good representation For example for a Linear classifierclassifier a good representation can be defined as one that yields a betterperforming classifier

An encoder is a deterministic mapping mathfthetamath that transforms an input vector x into hidden representation y where maththeta  boldsymbolW bmath mathboldsymbolWmath is the weight matrix and b is an offset vector bias A decoder maps back the hidden representation y to the reconstructed input z via mathgthetamath The whole process of auto encoding is to compare this reconstructed input to the original and try to minimize the error to make the reconstructed value as close as possible to the original

In stacked denoising auto encoders the partially corrupted output is cleaned denoised This idea was introduced in 2010 by Vincent et alref nameref9cite journallast2Larochellefirst2Hugolast3Lajoiefirst3Isabellelast4Bengiofirst4Yoshualast5Manzagolfirst5PierreAntoinedate2010titleStacked Denoising Autoencoders Learning Useful Representations in a Deep Network with a Local Denoising Criterionurlhttpdlacmorgcitationcfmid1953039journalThe Journal of Machine Learning Researchvolume11pages33713408last1Vincentfirst1Pascalref with a specific approach to good representation a good representation is one that can be obtained Robustness computer sciencerobustly from a corrupted input and that will be useful for recovering the corresponding clean input Implicit in this definition are the following ideas
 The higher level representations are relatively stable and robust to input corruption
 It is necessary to extract features that are useful for representation of the input distribution
The algorithm starts by a stochastic mapping of mathboldsymbolxmath to mathtildeboldsymbolxmath through mathqDtildeboldsymbolxboldsymbolxmath this is the corrupting step Then the corrupted input mathtildeboldsymbolxmath passes through a basic autoencoder process and is mapped to a hidden representation mathboldsymboly  fthetatildeboldsymbolx  sboldsymbolWtildeboldsymbolxbmath From this hidden representation we can reconstruct mathboldsymbolz  gthetaboldsymbolymath In the last stage a minimization algorithm runs in order to have z as close as possible to uncorrupted input mathboldsymbolxmath The reconstruction error mathLHboldsymbolxboldsymbolzmath might be either the crossentropy loss with an affinesigmoid decoder or the squared error loss with an Affine transformationaffine decoderref nameref9

 Deep predictive coding networks 
A deep predictive coding network DPCN is a Predictive modellingpredictive coding scheme that uses topdown information to empirically adjust the priors needed for a bottomup inference procedure by means of a deep locally connected generative model This works by extracting sparse Feature machine learningfeatures from timevarying observations using a linear dynamical model Then a pooling strategy is used to learn invariant feature representations These units compose to form a deep architecture and are trained by Greedy algorithmgreedy layerwise unsupervised learning The layers constitute a kind of Markov chain such that the states at any layer depend only on the preceding and succeeding layers

DPCNs predict the representation of the layer by using a topdown approach using the information in upper layer and temporal dependencies from previous statesref nameref56cite arXiveprint13013541first2Joselast2PrincipetitleDeep Predictive Coding Networksdate2013last1Chalasanifirst1RakeshclasscsLGref

Neuroscience
Theoretical neuroscience is concerned with the theoretical analysis and the computational modeling of biological neural systems

To gain this understanding neuroscientists are interested in linking observed biological processes to biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning biological neural network models

Brain research has repeatedly led to new ANN approaches such as the use of connections to connect neurons in other layers rather than adjacent neurons in the same layer Other research explored the use of multiple signal types or finer control than Boolean algebraboolean onoff variables Dynamic neural networks can dynamically form new connections and even new neural units while disabling othersrefCite weburlhttpswwwmathworkscomhelpnnetugintroductiontodynamicneuralnetworkshtmltitleIntroduction to Dynamic Neural Networks  MATLAB  Simulinkwebsitewwwmathworkscomaccessdate20170615ref

Types of models

Capacity
Models capacity property roughly corresponds to their ability to model any given function It is related to the amount of information that can be stored in the network and to the notion of complexitycitation neededdateFebruary 2017

Convergence
Models may not consistently converge on a single solution firstly because many local minima may exist depending on the cost function and the model Secondly the optimization method used might not guarantee to converge when it begins far from any local minimum Thirdly for sufficiently large data or parameters some methods become impractical However for cerebellar model articulation controllerCMAC neural network a recursive least squares algorithm was introduced to train it and  this algorithm can be guaranteed to converge in one stepref nameQin1

Generalization and statistics
Applications whose goal is to create a system that generalizes well to unseen examples face the possibility of overtraining This arises in convoluted or overspecified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters Two approaches address overtraining The first is to use crossvalidation statisticscrossvalidation and similar techniques to check for the presence of overtraining and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error The second is to use some form of regularization mathematicsregularization This concept emerges in a probabilistic Bayesian framework where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models but also in statistical learning theory where the goal is to minimize over two quantities the empirical risk and the structural risk which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to overfitting

FileSynapse deploymentjpgthumbrightConfidence analysis of a neural network
Supervised neural networks that use a mean squared error MSE cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine the confidence of the trained model The MSE on a validation set can be used as an estimate for variance This value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network assuming a normal distribution A confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified

By assigning a softmax activation function a generalization of the logistic function on the output layer of the neural network or a softmax component in a componentbased neural network for categorical target variables the outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities This is very useful in classification as it gives a certainty measure on classifications

Criticism

The motivation behind ANNs is not necessarily to strictly replicate neural function but to use biological neural networks as an inspiration A central claim of ANNs is therefore that it embodies some new and powerful general principle for processing information Unfortunately these general principles are illdefined It is often claimed that they are Emergent propertiesemergent from the network itself This allows simple statistical association the basic function of artificial neural networks to be described as learning or recognition Alexander Dewdney commented that as a result artificial neural networks have a somethingfornothing quality one that imparts a peculiar aura of laziness and a distinct lack of curiosity about just how good these computing systems are No human hand or mind intervenes solutions are found as if by magic and no one it seems has learned anythingrefcite bookurlgoogle books plainurly idKcHaAAAAMAAJpage82titleYes we have no neutrons an eyeopening tour through the twists and turns of bad sciencelastDewdneyfirstA Kdate1 April 1997publisherWileyyearisbn9780471108061locationpages82ref

Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented

blockquoteNeural networks for instance are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven what hasnt but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque unreadable tablevalueless as a scientific resource
In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth havingrefhttpmembersfortunecitycomtemplarseriespopperhtml Roger Bridgmans defence of neural networksref

Although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network Furthermore researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful For example local vs nonlocal learning and shallow vs deep architecturerefcite weburlhttpwwwiroumontrealcalisapublications2indexphppublicationsshow4titleScaling Learning Algorithms towards AI  LISA  Publications  Aigaion 20publisherref

Types
 Split to Types of artificial neural networks 
MainTypes of artificial neural networks

Artificial neural networks have many variations The simplest static types have one or more static components including number of units number of layers unit weights and topology Dynamic types allow one or more of these to change during the learning process The latter are much more complicated but can shorten learning periods and produce better results Some types allowrequire learning to be supervised by the operator while others operate independently Some types operate purely in hardware while others are purely software and run on general purpose computers
