The dodo Raphus cucullatus is an extinctionextinct flightless bird that was endemismendemic to the island of Mauritius east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean The dodos closest genetic distancegenetic relative was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire the two forming the taxonomic ranksubfamily Raphinae of the family biologyfamily of Columbidaepigeons and doves The closest extant taxonliving relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos

Subfossil remains show the dodo was about convert1mftin tall and may have weighed convert106175kglbabbron in the wild The dodos appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings paintings and written accounts from the 17th century Because these vary considerably and because only some illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens its exact appearance in life remains unresolved and little is known about its behaviour Though the dodo has historically been considered fat and clumsy it is now thought to have been welladapted for its ecosystem It has been depicted with brownishgrey plumage yellow feet a tuft of tail feathers a grey naked head and a black yellow and green beak It used gizzard stones to help digestiondigest its food which is thought to have included fruits and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius One account states its clutch eggsclutch consisted of a single egg It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius

The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598 In the following years the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species while its habitat was being destroyed The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 Its extinction was not immediately noticed and some considered it to be a mythical creature In the 19th century research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century Among these is a dried head the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today Since then a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alices Adventures in Wonderland and it has since become a fixture in popular culture often as a Bird extinctionsymbol of extinction and obsolescence

 Taxonomy

The dodo was variously declared a small ostrich a Rallidaerail an albatross or a vulture by early scientistssfnHumeChekeMcOranCampbell2009 In 1842 Danish zoologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt proposed that dodos were ground columbidaepigeons based on studies of a dodo skull he had discovered in the collection of the Natural History Museum of DenmarksfnReinhardt18421843 This view was met with ridicule but was later supported by English naturalists Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville in their 1848 monograph The Dodo and Its Kindred which attempted to separate myth from realitysfnBakerBayliss2002 After dissectiondissecting the embalmingpreserved head and foot of the specimen at the Oxford University Museum and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct Rodrigues solitaire Pezophaps solitaria they concluded that the two were closely related Strickland stated that although not identical these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones otherwise known only in pigeonssfnStricklandMelville1848pp4112
FileDodo headjpgthumbSketch of the Oxford head made before it was dissected in 1848
Strickland and Melville established that the dodo was anatomyanatomically similar to pigeons in many features They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak with its long slender naked basal part Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes almost reaching their beak as in dodos The forehead was high in relation to the beak and the beakNaresnostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin a combination of features shared only with pigeons The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial animalterrestrial pigeons than of other birds both in their bird anatomyScalesscales and in their skeletal features Depictions of the large crop anatomycrop hinted at a relationship with pigeons in which this feature is more developed than in other birds Pigeons generally have very small clutch eggsclutches and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg Like pigeons the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils and it shared details in the mandible the zygomatic bone the palate and the hallux The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion to the rest of the craniumsfnStricklandMelville1848pp4112

Throughout the 19th century several species were classified as conspecificitycongeneric with the dodo including the Rodrigues solitaire and the Réunion solitaire as Didus solitarius and Raphus solitarius respectively Didus and Raphus being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time An atypical 17thcentury description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire led Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species Didus nazarenus in 1852sfnNewton1865 Based on solitaire remains it is now a synonym of that speciessfnLydekker1891p128 Crude drawings of the red rail of Mauritius were also misinterpreted as dodo species Didus broeckii and Didus herbertisfnMilneEdwards1869

For many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a family biologyfamily of their own the Raphidae formerly Dididae because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved Each was also placed in its own monotypic taxonmonotypic family Raphidae and Pezophapidae respectively as it was thought that they had Convergent evolutionevolved their similarities independentlysfnStorer1970 Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily Raphinae within the family ColumbidaesfnJanoo2005

 Etymology 
FileRoelant Savery  Landscape with Birds  WGA20885jpgleftthumbaltPainting of a forest filled with birds including a dodoLandscape with Birds showing a dodo in the lower right Roelant Savery 1628
One of the original names for the dodo was the Dutch Walghvogel first used in the journal of Vice Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck who visited Mauritius during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia in 1598sfnHume2006 Walghe means tasteless insipid or sickly and vogel means bird The name was translated into German as Walchstök or Walchvögel by Jakob FriedlibsfnParish2013p5137 The original Dutch report titled Waarachtige Beschryving was lost but the English translation survivedsfnParish2013p34

Another account from that voyage perhaps the first to mention the dodo states that the Portuguese referred to them as penguins The meaning may not have been derived from penguin the Portuguese referred to them as fotilicaios at the time but from pinioningpinion a reference to the small wingssfnHume2006 The crew of the Dutch ship Gelderland referred to the bird as Dronte meaning swollen in 1602 a name that is still used in some languagessfnFuller2001pp194203 This crew also called them griffeendt and kermisgans in reference to fowl fattened for the Kermesse festival in Amsterdam which was held the day after they anchored on MauritiussfnChekeHume2008pp2223

The etymology of the word dodo is unclear Some ascribe it to the Dutch word dodoor for sluggard but it is more probably related to Dodaars which means either fatarse or knotarse referring to the knot of feathers on the hind endsfnFuller2002pp1718 The first record of the word Dodaars is in Captain Willem Van WestZanens journal in 1602sfnStaub1996 The English writer Sir Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word dodo in print in his 1634 travel journaltravelogue claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese who had visited Mauritius in 1507sfnChekeHume2008pp2223 Another Englishman Emmanuel Altham had used the word in a 1628 letter in which he also claimed the origin was Portuguese The name dodar was introduced into English at the same time as dodo but was only used until the 18th centurysfnChekeHume2008p276 As far as is known the Portuguese never mentioned the bird Nevertheless some sources still state that the word dodo derives from the Portuguese languagePortuguese word doudo currently doido meaning fool or crazy It has also been suggested that dodo was an Onomatopoeiaonomatopoeic approximation of the birds call a twonote pigeonlike sound resembling doodoosfnFuller2002p43

The skull of the dodo differed much from those of other pigeons especially in being more robust the bill having a hooked tip and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws The upper bill was nearly twice as long as the cranium which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated along the length of the beak and they contained no bony septum The cranium excluding the beak was wider than it was long and the frontal bone formed a domeshape with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets The skull sloped downwards at the back The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles small bones similar to the amount in other pigeons The mandible was slightly curved and each half had a single Fenestra anatomyfenestra opening as in other pigeonsref nameMorphology 2016

The dodo had about nineteen presynsacral vertebrae those of the neck and thorax including three fused into a notarium sixteen synsacral vertebrae those of the lumbar region and sacrum six free tail caudal vertebrae and a pygostyle The neck had welldeveloped areas for muscle and ligament attachment probably to support the heavy skull and beak On each side it had six ribs four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs The sternum was large but small in relation to the body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly The sternum was highly pneumatic broad and relatively thick in crosssection The bones of the pectoral girdle shoulder blades and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire however The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller flighted pigeons Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire but the length proportions were little differentref nameMorphology 2016

Many of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire its closest relative from pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight and the pectoralis major musclepectoral region and the small wings were neotenypaedomorphic meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features The skull trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic meaning that they changed considerably with age The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire such as features of the skull pelvis and sternum as well as their large size It differed in other aspects such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire having a larger skull and beak a rounded skull roof and smaller orbits The dodos neck and legs were proportionally shorter and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaires wristssfnLivezey1993

Because of the possible singleegg clutch and the birds large size it has been proposed that the dodo was Kselected meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring which required parental care until they matured Some evidence including the large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development periodsfnLivezey1993 The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring that they matured rapidly that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp or that the risk of miring was seasonalsfnMeijerGillde Louwvan den Hoek Ostende2012pp177184

A 2017 study examined the histology of thinsectioned dodo bones modern Mauritian birds local ecology and contemporary accounts to recover information about the life history of the dodo The study suggested that dodos bred around August after having potentially fattened themselves corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius The chicks grew rapidly reaching robust almost adult sizes and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer around March The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first and the moulting would have completed at the end of July in time for the next breeding season Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumagerefcite journallast1Angstfirst1Dlast2Chinsamyfirst2Alast3Steelfirst3Llast4Humefirst4J PtitleBone histology sheds new light on the ecology of the dodo Raphus cucullatus Aves ColumbiformesjournalScientific Reportsdate2017volume7doi101038s41598017085363pmc5570941issn20452322pmid28839147ref

The supposed white dodo or solitaire of Réunion is now considered an erroneous conjecture based on contemporary reports of the Réunion ibis and 17thcentury paintings of white dodolike birds by Pieter Withoos and Pieter Holsteyn IIPieter Holsteyn that surfaced in the 19th century The confusion began when Willem Ysbrandtsz BontekoeWillem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe who visited Réunion around 1619 mentioned fat flightless birds that he referred to as Dodeersen in his journal though without mentioning their colouration When the journal was published in 1646 it was accompanied by an engraving of a dodo from Saverys Crocker Art Gallery sketchsfnChekeHume2008p30 A white stocky and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the Réunion fauna by Chief Officer J Tatton in 1625 Sporadic mentions were subsequently made by Sieur Dubois and other contemporary writerssfnRothschild1907pp172173

Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps coined the name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848 as he believed the accounts referred to a species of dodo When 17thcentury paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19thcentury naturalists it was assumed they depicted these birds Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphicsfnRothschild1919 Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire as it was referred to by the same name or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the islandsfnChekeHume2008pp3031

The Pieter Withoos painting which was discovered first appears to be based on an earlier painting by Pieter Holsteyn three versions of which are known to have existed According to Hume Cheke and Valledor de Lozoya it appears that all depictions of white dodos were based on Roelant Saverys 1611 painting Landscape with Orpheus and the animals or on copies of it The painting shows a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague a walghvogel described as having a dirty offwhite colouring was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the Rudolf II Holy Roman EmperorHoly Roman Emperor Rudolf II to whom Savery was contracted at the time 16071611 Saverys several later images all show greyish birds possibly because he had by then seen another specimen Cheke and Hume believe the painted specimen was white owing to albinismsfnHumeCheke2004 Valledor de Lozoya has instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens or simply artistic licensesfnde Lozoya2003

In 1987 scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of ibis from Réunion with a relatively short beak Borbonibis latipes before a connection to the solitaire reports had been madesfnMourerChauviréMoutou1987 Cheke suggested to one of the authors Francois Moutou that the fossils may have been of the Réunion solitaire and this suggestion was published in 1995 The ibis was reassigned to the genus Threskiornis now combined with the specific name zoologyspecific epithet langlasolitarius from the binomial nomenclaturebinomial R solitariussfnMourerChauviréBourRibes1995 Birds of this genus are also white and black with slender beaks fitting the old descriptions of the Réunion solitaire No fossil remains of dodolike birds have ever been found on the islandsfnHumeCheke2004
