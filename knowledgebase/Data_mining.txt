The actual data mining task is the semiautomatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data records cluster analysis unusual records anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining sequential pattern mining This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indexspatial indices These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data and may be used in further analysis or for example in machine learning and predictive analytics For example the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system Neither the data collection data preparation nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps

The related terms data dredging data fishing and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are or may be too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered These methods can however be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations

Etymology
In the 1960s statisticians and economists used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an apriori hypothesis The term data mining was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the Review of Economic Studies 1983 Lovell indicates that the practice masquerades under a variety of aliases ranging from experimentation positive to fishing or snooping negativerefCite journallastLovellfirstMichael Cdate1983titleData MiningjournalThe Review of Economics and Statisticsvolume65issue1pages112doi1023071924403jstor1924403ref

Background
The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes theorem 1700s and regression analysis 1800s The proliferation ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection storage and manipulation ability As data sets have grown in size and complexity direct handson data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect automated data processing aided by other discoveries in computer science such as neural networks cluster analysis genetic algorithms 1950s decision tree learningdecision trees and decision rules 1960s and support vector machines 1990s Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patternsref nameKantardziccite book lastKantardzic firstMehmed titleData Mining Concepts Models Methods and Algorithms year2003 publisherJohn Wiley  Sons isbn0471228524 oclc50055336 ref in large data sets It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence which usually provide the mathematical background to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets

Preprocessing
Before data mining algorithms can be used a target data set must be assembled As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse Preprocessing is essential to analyze the Multivariate statisticsmultivariate data sets before data mining The target set is then cleaned Data cleaning removes the observations containing statistical noisenoise and those with missing data

Data mining

 Anomaly detection outlierchangedeviation detection  The identification of unusual data records that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation
 Association rule learning dependency modelling  Searches for relationships between variables For example a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits Using association rule learning the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis
 Cluster analysisClustering  is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another similar without using known structures in the data
 Statistical classificationClassification  is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data For example an email program might attempt to classify an email as legitimate or as spam
 Regression analysisRegression  attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error that is for estimating the relationships among data or datasets
 Automatic summarizationSummarization  providing a more compact representation of the data set including visualization and report generation

Data mining can unintentionally be misused and can then produce results which appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behaviour and cannot be Reproducibilityreproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a traintest split  when applicable at all  may not be sufficient to prevent this from happeningref namehawkinscite journal  last1  Hawkins  first1  Douglas M  year  2004  title  The problem of overfitting  url   journal  Journal of chemical information and computer sciences  volume  44  issue  1 pages  112  doi101021ci0342472 pmid  14741005 ref

Missing informationsectionnonclassification tasks in data mining It only covers machine learningdateSeptember 2011
The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set This is called overfitting To overcome this the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained The learned patterns are applied to this test set and the resulting output is compared to the desired output For example a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish spam from legitimate emails would be trained on a training set of sample emails Once trained the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of emails on which it had not been trained The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many emails they correctly classify A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm such as Receiver operating characteristicROC curves

If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards subsequently it is necessary to reevaluate and change the preprocessing and data mining steps If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge

Standards
There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process for example the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining CRISPDM 10 and the 2004 Java Data Mining standard JDM 10 Development on successors to these processes CRISPDM 20 and JDM 20 was active in 2006 but has stalled since JDM 20 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft

For exchanging the extracted models  in particular for use in predictive analyticsnbsp the key standard is the Predictive Model Markup Language PMML which is an XMLbased language developed by the Data Mining Group DMG and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications As the name suggests it only covers prediction models a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications However extensions to cover for example subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMGrefCite book  last1  Günnemann  first1  Stephan  last2  Kremer  first2  Hardy  last3  Seidl  first3  Thomas  doi  10114520235982023605  chapter  An extension of the PMML standard to subspace clustering models  title  Proceedings of the 2011 workshop on Predictive markup language modeling  PMML 11  pages  48  year  2011  isbn  9781450308373  pmid    pmc  ref

Situation in Europe

Europe has rather strong privacy laws and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers However the International Safe Harbor Privacy PrinciplesUSEU Safe Harbor Principles currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by US companies As a consequence of Edward Snowdens global surveillance disclosure there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency and attempts to reach an agreement have failedcitation neededdateApril 2014

Situation in the United States

In the United States privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act HIPAA The HIPAA requires individuals to give their informed consent regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses According to an article in Biotech Business Week in practice HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena says the AAHC More importantly the rules goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individualsrefBiotech Business Week Editors June 30 2008 BIOMEDICINE HIPAA Privacy Rule Impedes Biomedical Research Biotech Business Week retrieved 17 November 2009 from LexisNexis Academicref This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices

US information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act FERPA applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses Use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the US is not controlled by any legislation

Copyright law

Situation in Europe

Due to a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and Database Directivedatabase law the mining of incopyright works such as web mining without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal Where a database is pure data in Europe there is likely to be no copyright but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the Database Directive On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014refhttpwwwoutlawcomenarticles2014juneresearchersgivendataminingrightundernewukcopyrightlaws UK Researchers Given Data Mining Right Under New UK Copyright Laws webarchive urlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20140609020315httpwwwoutlawcomenarticles2014juneresearchersgivendataminingrightundernewukcopyrightlaws dateJune 9 2014  OutLawcom   Retrieved 14 November 2014ref to allow content mining as a Limitations and exceptions to copyrightlimitation and exception Only the second country in the world to do so after Japan which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining However due to the restriction of the Copyright Directive the UK exception only allows content mining for noncommercial purposes UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013 under the title of Licences for Europerefcite webtitleLicences for Europe  Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013urlhttpeceuropaeulicencesforeuropedialogueencontentaboutsitewebsiteEuropean Commissionaccessdate14 November 2014ref The focus on the solution to this legal issue being licences and not limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities researchers libraries civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013refcite webtitleText and Data MiningIts importance and the need for change in EuropeurlhttplibereuropeeunewstextanddataminingitsimportanceandtheneedforchangeineuropewebsiteAssociation of European Research Librariesaccessdate14 November 2014ref
