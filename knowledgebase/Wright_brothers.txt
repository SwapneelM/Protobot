Early career and research
FileWrightBrothersHomejpgthumbleftWright brothers home at 7 Hawthorn Street Dayton about 1900 Wilbur and Orville built the covered wraparound porch in the 1890s
Both brothers attended high school but did not receive diplomas The familys abrupt move in 1884 from Richmond Indiana to Dayton Ohio where the family had lived during the 1870s prevented Wilbur from receiving his diploma after finishing four years of high school The diploma was awarded posthumously to Wilbur on April 16 1994 which would have been his 127th birthdayrefhttpwwwwaynetorgfactsdefaulthtm Waynet Facts and Fun Information Wayne County IN Retrieved July 5 2015ref

In late 1885 or early 1886 Wilbur was struck in the face by a hockey stick while playing an iceskating game with friends resulting in the loss of his front teeth He had been vigorous and athletic until then and although his injuries did not appear especially severe he became withdrawn  He had planned to attend Yale  Instead he spent the next few years largely housebound  During this time he cared for his mother who was terminally ill with tuberculosis read extensively in his fathers library and ably assisted his father during Church of the United Brethren in Christ New Constitutiontimes of controversy within the Brethren ChurchrefJakab 1997 p 164ref but also expressed unease over his own lack of ambitionrefCrouch 2003 p 130ref

Ideas about control
FileWrightBrothers1899KitejpgrightthumbWright 1899 kite front and side views with control sticks Wingwarping is shown in lower view Wright brothers drawing in Library of Congress

Despite Lilienthals fate the brothers favored his strategy to practice gliding in order to master the art of control before attempting motordriven flight The death of British aeronaut Percy Pilcher in another hang gliding crash in October 1899 only reinforced their opinion that a reliable method of pilot control was the key to successfuland safeflight At the outset of their experiments they regarded control as the unsolved third part of the flying problem They believed sufficiently promising knowledge of the other two issueswings and enginesalready existedrefCrouch 2003 p 166ref The Wright brothers thus differed sharply from more experienced practitioners of the day notably Clément Ader Hiram MaximMaxim and Langley who built powerful engines attached them to airframes equipped with unproven control devices and expected to take to the air with no previous flying experience Although agreeing with Lilienthals idea of practice the Wrights saw that his method of balance and control by shifting his body weight was inadequaterefTobin 2004 p 53ref They were determined to find something better

On the basis of observation Wilbur concluded that birds changed the angle of the ends of their wings to make their bodies roll right or leftrefTobin 2004 p 70ref The brothers decided this would also be a good way for a flying machine to turnto bank or lean into the turn just like a birdand just like a person riding a bicycle an experience with which they were thoroughly familiar Equally important they hoped this method would enable recovery when the wind tilted the machine to one side lateral balance They puzzled over how to achieve the same effect with manmade wings and eventually discovered wingwarping when Wilbur idly twisted a long innertube box at the bicycle shoprefTobin 2004 pp 5355ref

Other aeronautical investigators regarded flight as if it were not so different from surface locomotion except the surface would be elevated They thought in terms of a ships rudder for steering while the flying machine remained essentially level in the air as did a train or an automobile or a ship at the surface The idea of deliberately leaning or rolling to one side seemed either undesirable or did not enter their thinkingrefCrouch 2003 pp 167168ref Some of these other investigators including Langley and Chanute sought the elusive ideal of inherent stability believing the pilot of a flying machine would not be able to react quickly enough to wind disturbances to use mechanical controls effectively The Wright brothers on the other hand wanted the pilot to have absolute controlrefCrouch 2003 pp 168169ref For that reason their early designs made no concessions toward builtin stability such as Dihedral aircraftdihedral wings They deliberately designed their 1903 first powered flyer with Dihedral aircraftAnhedralanhedral drooping wings which are inherently unstable but less susceptible to upset by gusty cross winds

Flights

They tested wingwarping using control ropes from the ground The glider was also tested unmanned while suspended from a small homemade tower Wilbur but not Orville made about a dozen free glides on only a single day October 20 For those tests the brothers trekked four miles 6nbspkm south to the Kill Devil Hills a group of sand dunes up to convert100ftm1 high where they made camp in each of the next three years Although the gliders lift was less than expected the brothers were encouraged because the crafts front elevator worked well and they had no accidents However the small number of free glides meant they were not able to give wingwarping a true test

The pilot lay flat on the lower wing as planned to reduce aerodynamic drag As a glide ended the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a vertical position through an opening in the wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework Within a few glides however they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing headfirst without undue danger when landing They made all their flights in that position for the next five years

The Wrights used this equation to calculate the amount of lift that a wing would produce Over the years a wide variety of values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient Chanute identified up to 50 of them Wilbur knew that Langley for example had used a lower number than the traditional one Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider His results correctly showed that the coefficient was very close to 00033 similar to the number Langley used not the traditional 00054 which would significantly exaggerate predicted liftrefCrouch The Bishops Boys 1989 pp 220221ref

To learn whether errors actually existed in Lilienthals data tables the brothers used a bicycle for a new type of experiment They made a modelsize airfoil and a counteracting flat plate both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthals formula predicted The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthals coefficients of lift and dragor all of themwere in errorrefCrouch The Bishops Boys 1989 pp 221222refref nameKittyHawkBox

Lilienthal had made whirling arm tests on only a few wing shapes and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings which had a different shape The Wrights took a huge step forward and made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves followed by detailed tests on 38 of them The tests according to biographer Fred Howard were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expenserefHoward 1988 p 72ref An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings in aeronautical terms wings with a larger aspect ratio wingspan divided by Chord aircraftchordthe wings fronttoback dimension Such shapes offered much better lifttodrag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far

With this knowledge and a more accurate Smeaton number the Wrights designed their 1902 glider Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel they made the airfoil flatter reducing the camber the depth of the wings curvature divided by its chord The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results the Wrights discarded Lilienthals data now basing their designs on their own calculations

With characteristic caution the brothers first flew the 1902 glider as an unmanned kite as they had done with their two previous versions Rewarding their wind tunnel work the glider produced the expected lift It also had a new structural feature a fixed rear vertical rudder which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems

By 1902 they realized that wingwarping created differential drag at the wingtips Greater lift at one end of the wing also increased drag which slowed that end of the wing making the glider swivelor yawso the nose pointed away from the turn That was how the tailless 1901 glider behaved
File1902 WrightBrosGliderjpgleftthumbuprightWilbur Wright pilots the 1902 Wright Glider1902 glider over the Kill Devil Hills October 10 1902 The single rear rudder is steerable it replaced the original fixed double rudder
The improved wing design enabled consistently longer glides and the rear rudder prevented adverse yawso effectively that it introduced a new problem Sometimes when the pilot attempted to level off from a turn the glider failed to respond to corrective wingwarping and persisted into a tighter turn The glider would slide toward the lower wing which hit the ground spinning the aircraft around The Wrights called this well digging

Orville apparently visualized that the fixed rudder resisted the effect of corrective wingwarping when attempting to level off from a turn He wrote in his diary that on the night of October 2 I studied out a new vertical rudder The brothers then decided to make the rear rudder movable to solve the problemrefAnderson 2004 p 134ref They hinged the rudder and connected it to the pilots warping cradle so a single movement by the pilot simultaneously controlled wingwarping and rudder deflection Tests while gliding proved that the trailing edge of the rudder should be turned away from whichever end of the wings had more drag and lift due to warping The opposing pressure produced by turning the rudder enabled corrective wingwarping to reliably restore level flight after a turn or a wind disturbance Furthermore when the glider banked into a turn rudder pressure overcame the effect of differential drag and pointed the nose of the aircraft in the direction of the turn eliminating adverse yaw

In short the Wrights discovered the true purpose of the movable vertical rudder Its role was not to change the direction of flight as a rudder does in sailing but rather to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbancesrefCulick Fred EC httpwwwwrightflyerorgwpcontentuploads201210FlightMechanicsInModernTermspdf What the Wright Brothers Did and Did Not Understand About Flight MechanicsIn Modern Terms Pasadena California American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics California Institute of Technology Paper AIAA20013385 37th AIAAASMESAEASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit July 811 2001 Retrieved February 20 2017ref The actual turnthe change in directionwas done with roll control using wingwarping The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wingwarping

With their new method the Wrights achieved true control in turns for the first time on October 8 1902 a major milestone From September 19 to October 24 they made between 700 and 1000 glides the longest lasting 26 seconds and covering convert6225ftm1 Hundreds of wellcontrolled glides after they made the rudder steerable convinced them they were ready to build a powered flying machine

Thus did flight dynamicsthreeaxis control evolve wingwarping for roll lateral motion forward elevator for pitch up and down and rear rudder for yaw side to side On March 23 1903 the Wrights applied for their famous patent for a Flying Machine based on their successful 1902 glider Some aviation historians believe that applying the system of threeaxis flight control on the 1902 glider was equal to or even more significant than the addition of power to the 1903 Flyer Peter Jakab of the Smithsonian asserts that perfection of the 1902 glider essentially represents invention of the airplanerefLangewiesche 1972 p 163refrefJakab 1997 pp 183184ref

Patent war

The Wright brothers wrote their 1903 patent application themselves but it was rejected In January 1904 they hired Ohio patent attorney Henry Toulmin and on May 22 1906 they were granted US Patent 821393ref nameFlying Machine patent for new and useful Improvements in Flying Machines

FileWrightPatentIntrojpgthumbcenterUS Patent and Trademark Office archivecenter

The patent illustrates a nonpowered flying machinenamely the 1902 glider The patents importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of controlling a flying machine powered or not The technique of wingwarping is described but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wingwarping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machines wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral roll control The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips by any suitable method is central to the patent The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wingwarping enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider Finally the patent describes the forward elevator used for ascending and descending

Lawsuits begin
Attempting to circumvent the patent Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators devised ailerons to emulate lateral control described in the patent and demonstrated by the Wrights in their public flights
Soon after the historic July 4 1908 onekilometer flight by Curtiss in the AEA June Bug the Wrights warned him not to infringe their patent by profiting from flying or selling aircraft that used ailerons

Curtiss was at the time a member of the Aerial Experiment Association AEA headed by Alexander Graham Bell where in 1908 he had helped reinvent wingtip ailerons for their Aerodrome No 2 known as the AEA White Wingref nameAerospacewebYoon Joe httpwwwaerospaceweborgquestionhistoryq0103shtml Origins of Control Surfaces Aerospaceweborg November 17 2002refref nameCaseyCasey Louis S httpsbooksgooglecombooksidPXtGAAAAYAAJ Curtiss The Hammondsport Era 19071915 New York Crown Publishers 1981 pp 1215 ISBN9780517543269ref the AEAs other members became dismayed when Curtiss unexpectedly dropped out of their organization they later came to believe he had sold the rights to their joint innovation to the United States GovernmentCitation neededdateNovember 2012

European companies which bought foreign patents the Wrights had received sued other manufacturers in their countries Those lawsuits were only partly successful Despite a proWright ruling in France legal maneuvering dragged on until the patent expired in 1917 A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903 In the US the Wrights made an agreement with the Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved freeing participating pilots from a legal threat Promoters of approved shows paid fees to the Wrights

The Wright brothers won their initial case against Curtiss in February 1913 when a judge ruled that ailerons were covered under the patent The Curtiss company appealed the decision

From 1910 until his death from typhoid fever in 1912 Wilbur took the leading role in the patent struggle traveling incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause particularly against Curtiss who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft The Wrights preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers Indeed aviation development in the US was suppressed to such an extent that when the US entered World War I no acceptable Americandesigned airplanes were available and US forces were compelled to use French machines Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilburs premature death which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle

Victory and cooperation
In January 1914 a US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict against the Curtiss company which continued to avoid penalties through legal tactics Orville apparently felt vindicated by the decision and much to the frustration of company executives he did not push vigorously for further legal action to ensure a manufacturing monopoly In fact he was planning to sell the company and departed in 1915 In 1917 with World War I underway the US government pressured the industry to form a crosslicensing organization the Manufacturers Aircraft Association to which member companies paid a blanket fee for the use of aviation patents including the original and subsequent Wright patentsref namewbcentflightcite weburlhttpwwwcentennialofflightgovessayWrightBrosPatentBattlesWR12htmtitleGlenn Curtiss and the Wright Patent Battlespublishercentennialofflightdate2003accessdateMarch 7 2009archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20121022185447httpwwwcentennialofflightgovessayWrightBrosPatentBattlesWR12htmarchivedateOctober 22 2012deadurlyesrefrefnQuote The suit finally ended with the advent of World War I when the aircraft manufacturers established the Manufacturers Aircraft Association to coordinate wartime aircraft manufacturing in the United States and formed a patent pool with the approval of the US government All patent litigation ceased automatically Royalties were reduced to one percent and free exchange of inventions and ideas took place among all the airframe builders groupN The WrightMartin company successor to the Wright company and the Curtiss company which held a number of its own patents each received a 2nbspmillion paymentrefhttpsquerynytimescomgstabstracthtmlres9906E2D8133AE433A25754C0A96E9C946696D6CF End Patent Wars of Aircraft Makers The New York Times August 7 1917 Retrieved March 7 2009refrefnQuote New Organization Is Formed Under War Pressure to Interchange PatentsgroupNrefBig Royalties to be Paid Wright and Curtiss Interests Each to Receive Ultimately 2000000nbsp Increased Production Predicted Payment of Royalties The New York Times August 7 1917 Retrieved March 7 2009ref The patent war ended although side issues lingered in the courts until the 1920s In a twist of irony the Wright Aeronautical Corporation another successor and the Curtiss Aeroplane company merged in 1929 to form the CurtissWright Corporation which remains in business today producing hightech components for the aerospace industry

Public reactions
The lawsuits damaged the public image of the Wright brothers who were generally regarded before this as heroes Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors who worked more openly Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention Their 10year friendship with Octave Chanute already strained by tension over how much credit if any he might deserve for their success collapsed after he publicly criticized their actionsrefHoward 1998 chapter 39 End of a Friendshipref

In mid1910 the Wrights changed the design of the Wright Flyer moving the horizontal elevator from the front to the back and adding wheels although keeping the skids as part of the undercarriage unit It had become apparent by then that a rear elevator would make an airplane easier to control especially as higher speeds grew more common The new version was designated the Model B although the original canard design was never referred to as the Model A by the Wrights However the US Army Signal Corps which bought the airplane did call it Wright Type ArefCragg 1973 p 272refrefn The author obtained information at the Fort Sam Houston Museum that also records the place of the flights as the Arthur MacArthur Field then used for cavalry drillgroupN

The US states of Ohio and North Carolina both take credit for the Wright brothers and their worldchanging inventionsOhio because the brothers developed and built their design in Dayton and North Carolina because Kitty Hawk was the site of the Wrights first powered flight With a spirit of friendly rivalry Ohio adopted the slogan Birthplace of Aviation later Birthplace of Aviation Pioneers recognizing not only the Wrights but also astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong both Ohio natives The slogan appears on Vehicle registration plates of OhioOhio license plates North Carolina uses the slogan First In Flight on its license plates

The site of the first flights in North Carolina is preserved as Wright Brothers National Memorial while their Ohio facilities are part of Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park As the positions of both states can be factually defended and each played a significant role in the history of flight neither state has an exclusive claim to the Wrights accomplishment

Notwithstanding the competition between those two states in 1937 the Wrights final bicycle shop and home were moved from Dayton to Greenfield Village in Dearborn Michigan where they remain
