Born and raised in the Austrian Empire Tesla received an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry He emigrated to the United States in 1884 where he would become a naturalized citizen He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices His alternating current AC induction motor and related Polyphase systempolyphase AC patents licensed by Westinghouse Electric CorporationWestinghouse Electric in 1888 earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market

Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillatorsgenerators electrical discharge tubes and early Xray imaging He also built a wirelesscontrolled boat one of the first ever exhibited Tesla became well known as an inventor and would demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures

Throughout the 1890s Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his highvoltage highfrequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs In 1893 he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter but ran out of funding before he could complete itref nametsteslatowercite webtitleTesla Tower in Shoreham Suffolk County Long Island 190117 meant to be the World Wireless Broadcasting systemurlhttpwwwteslasocietycomteslatowerhtmpublisherTesla Memorial Society of New Yorkaccessdate3 June 2012ref
