 Features and philosophy 
Python is a multiparadigm programming language Objectoriented programming and structured programming are fully supported and many of its features support functional programming and aspectoriented programming including by metaprogrammingref nameAutoNT13  and metaobjects magic methodsref nameAutoNT14  Many other paradigms are supported via extensions including design by contractref nameAutoNT15 ref nameAutoNT16  and logic programmingref nameAutoNT17 

Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycledetecting garbage collector for memory management It also features dynamic Name resolution programming languagesname resolution late binding which binds method and variable names during program execution

Pythons design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp programming languageLisp tradition It has codefiltercode codemapcode and codereducecode functions list comprehensions Associative arraydictionaries and sets and Generator computer programminggenerator expressionsref nameAutoNT59 The standard library has two modules itertools and functools that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell programming languageHaskell and Standard MLref nameAutoNT18 

The languages core philosophy is summarized in the document The Zen of Python PEP 20 which includes aphorisms such asref namePEP20 
 Note this isnt a full list just some of the more significant aphorisms 
 Beautiful is better than ugly
 Explicit is better than implicit
 Simple is better than complex
 Complex is better than complicated
 Readability counts

Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core Python was designed to be highly extensible This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications Van Rossums vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC programming languageABC which espoused the opposite approachref namevennersinterviewpt1 

While offering choice in coding methodology the Python philosophy rejects exuberant syntax such as that of Perl in favor of a simpler lesscluttered grammar As Alex Martelli put it To describe something as clever is not considered a compliment in the Python cultureref nameAutoNT19  Pythons philosophy rejects the Perl there is more than one way to do it approach to language design in favor of there should be oneand preferably only oneobvious way to do itref namePEP20 

Pythons developers strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to noncritical parts of CPython that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarityref nameAutoNT20  When speed is important a Python programmer can move timecritical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C or use PyPy a justintime compilationjustintime compiler Cython is also available which translates a Python script into C and makes direct Clevel API calls into the Python interpreter

An important goal of Pythons developers is keeping it fun to use This is reflected in the languages namea tribute to the British comedy group Monty Pythonref nameAutoNT24and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials such as examples that refer to spam and eggs from a Spam Monty Pythonfamous Monty Python sketch instead of the standard Foobarfoo and barrefcite web urlhttpinsidetechmonstercomtrainingarticles811415wayspythonisapowerfulforceontheweb title15 Ways Python Is a Powerful Force on the Webrefrefcite web urlhttpsdocspythonorg2librarypprinthtml titlepprint  Data pretty printer  Python Documentationref

A common neologism in the Python community is pythonic which can have a wide range of meanings related to program style To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well that it is natural or shows fluency in the language that it conforms with Pythons minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability In contrast code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic

Users and admirers of Python especially those considered knowledgeable or experienced are often referred to as Pythonists Pythonistas and Pythoneersref nameAutoNT27 ref nameAutoNT25 

 Syntax and semantics 
Main articlePython syntax and semantics

Python is meant to be an easily readable language Its formatting is visually uncluttered and it often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation Unlike many other languages it does not use curly bracket programming languagecurly brackets to delimit blocks and semicolons after statements are optional It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C programming languageC or Pascal programming languagePascalref nameAutoNT52 

 Indentation 
Main articlePython syntax and semanticsIndentation

Python uses whitespace characterwhitespace indentation rather than curly bracket programming languagecurly brackets or keywords to delimit block programmingblocks An increase in indentation comes after certain statements a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current blockref nameAutoNT53  Thus the programs visual structure accurately represents the programs semantic structureref nameguttagCite book publisher  MIT Press isbn  9780262529624 last  Guttag first  John V title  Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python With Application to Understanding Data date  20160812ref This feature is also sometimes termed the offside rule

 Statements and control flow 
Pythons Statement computer sciencestatements include among others

 The assignment statement token  the equals sign This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages and this fundamental mechanism including the nature of Pythons version of variables illuminates many other features of the language Assignment in C programming languageC eg codex  2code translates to typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2 The righthand value is copied into an Memory allocationallocated storage location for which the lefthand Variable computer sciencevariable name is the symbolic address The memory allocated to the variable is large enough potentially quite large for the declared Type systemtype In the simplest case of Python assignment using the same example codex  2code translates to generic name x receives a Pointer computer programmingreference to a separate dynamically allocated Object computer scienceobject of numeric int type of value 2 This is termed binding the name to the object Since the names storage location doesnt contain the indicated value it is improper to call it a variable Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types including strings procedures complex objects with data and methods etc Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names eg codex  2code codey  2code codez  2code result in allocating storage to at most three names and one numeric object to which all three names are bound Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed Type systemdata type with it However at a given time a name will be bound to some object which will have a type thus there is Dynamic typedynamic typing

 Python makes a distinction between list computer sciencelists and tuples Lists are written as code1 2 3code are mutable and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries dictionary keys must be immutable in Python Tuples are written as code1 2 3code are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries provided all elements of the tuple are immutable The codecode operator can be used to concatenate two tuples which does not directly modify their contents but rather produces a new tuple containing the elements of both provided tuples Thus given the variable codetcode initially equal to code1 2 3code executing codet  t  4 5code first evaluates codet  4 5code which yields code1 2 3 4 5code which is then assigned back to codetcode thereby effectively modifying the contents of codetcode while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contextsrefcite webtitle4 Builtin Types 8212 Python 363rc1 documentationurlhttpsdocspythonorg3librarystdtypeshtmltuplewebsitepythonorgaccessdate1 October 2017ref 
 Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions each evaluating to anything that can be assigned to a variable a writable property etc are associated in the identical manner to that forming tuple literals and as a whole are put on the left hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement The statement expects an iterable object on the right hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions when iterated through and will iterate through it assigning each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the leftcitation neededdateOctober 2017

 Python has various kinds of string literals
 Strings delimited by single or double quote marks Unlike in Unix shells Perl and Perlinfluenced languages single quote marks and double quote marks function identically Both kinds of string use the backslash codecode as an escape character String interpolation became available in Python 36 as formatted string literalsref namepep0498
 Triplequoted strings which begin and end with a series of three single or double quote marks They may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells Perl and Ruby programming languageRuby
 Raw string varieties denoted by prefixing the string literal with an codercode Escape sequences are not interpreted hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common such as regular expressions and Microsoft WindowsWindowsstyle paths Compare codecodequoting in C Sharp programming languageC
 Python has array index and array slicing expressions on lists denoted as codeakeycode codeastartstopcode or codeastartstopstepcode Indexes are zerobased and negative indexes are relative to the end Slices take elements from the start index up to but not including the stop index The third slice parameter called step or stride allows elements to be skipped and reversed Slice indexes may be omitted for example codeacode returns a copy of the entire list Each element of a slice is a shallow copy

In Python a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp Scheme programming languageScheme or Ruby programming languageRuby This leads to duplicating some functionality For example

 List comprehensions vs codeforcodeloops
 Conditional programmingConditional expressions vs codeifcode blocks
 The codeevalcode vs codeexeccode builtin functions in Python 2 codeexeccode is a statement the former is for expressions the latter is for statements

Statements cannot be a part of an expression so list and other comprehensions or Lambda programminglambda expressions all being expressions cannot contain statements A particular case of this is that an assignment statement such as codea  1code cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement This has the advantage of avoiding a classic C error of mistaking an assignment operator codecode for an equality operator codecode in conditions codeif c  1   code is syntactically valid but probably unintended C code but codeif c  1 code causes a syntax error in Python

 Methods 
Method programmingMethods on objects are function programmingfunctions attached to the objects class the syntax codeinstancemethodargumentcode is for normal methods and functions syntactic sugar for codeClassmethodinstance argumentcode Python methods have an explicit codethis computer programmingselfcode parameter to access instance data in contrast to the implicit codeselfcode or codethiscode in some other objectoriented programming languages eg C Java programming languageJava ObjectiveC or Ruby programming languageRubyref nameAutoNT61 

 Typing 
Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names Type constraints are not checked at compile time rather operations on an object may fail signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type Despite being Type systemDynamic type checking and runtime type informationdynamically typed Python is strongly typed programming languagestrongly typed forbidding operations that are not welldefined for example adding a number to a string rather than silently attempting to make sense of them

Python allows programmers to define their own types using class computer scienceclasses which are most often used for objectoriented programming New object computer scienceinstances of classes are constructed by calling the class for example codeSpamClasscode or codeEggsClasscode and the classes are instances of the metaclass codetypecode itself an instance of itself allowing metaprogramming and reflection computer sciencereflection

The behavior of division has changed significantly over timeref namepep0238

 Python 21 and earlier use the C division behavior The codecode operator is integer division if both operands are integers and floatingpoint division otherwise Integer division rounds towards 0 eg nowrap1code73  2code and nowrap1code73  2code
 Python 22 changes integer division to round towards negative infinity eg code73  2code and code73  3code The floor division codecode operator is introduced So code73  2code code73  3code code753  20code and code753  30code Adding codefrom future import divisioncode causes a module to use Python 30 rules for division see next
 Python 30 changes codecode to be always floatingpoint division In Python terms the pre30 codecode is classic division the version30 codecode is real division and codecode is floor division

Rounding towards negative infinity though different from most languages adds consistency For instance it means that the equation codea  bb  ab  1code is always true It also means that the equation codebab  ab  acode is valid for both positive and negative values of codeacode However maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of codeabcode is as expected in the halfopen interval 0 b where codebcode is a positive integer it has to lie in the interval b 0 when codebcode is negativeref nameAutoNT62 

Python provides a coderoundcode function for rounding a float to the nearest integer For RoundingTiebreakingtiebreaking versions before 3 use roundawayfromzero coderound05code is 10 coderound05code is 10ref nameAutoNT63  Python 3 uses round to even coderound15code is 2 coderound25code is 2ref nameAutoNT64 

Python allows boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics For example the expression codea  b  ccode tests whether codeacode is less than codebcode and codebcode is less than codeccode Cderived languages interpret this expression differently in C the expression would first evaluate codea  bcode resulting in 0 or 1 and that result would then be compared with codeccoderef nameAutoNT65 Page neededdateJanuary 2012

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications for example the Web Server Gateway Interface WSGI implementation codewsgirefcode follows PEP 333ref nameAutoNT89  but most modules are not They are specified by their code internal documentation and test suites if supplied However because most of the standard library is crossplatform Python code only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations

Most Python implementations including CPython include a readevalprint loop REPL permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives results immediately

Other shells including IDLE PythonIDLE and IPython add further abilities such as autocompletion session state retention and syntax highlighting

As well as standard desktop integrated development environments see Wikipedias Python IDE article there are Web browserbased IDEs SageMath intended for developing science and mathrelated Python programs PythonAnywhere a browserbased IDE and hosting environment and Canopy IDE a commercial Python IDE emphasizing scientific computingrefcite weblast1Enthoughtfirst1Canopy titleCanopy urlhttpswwwenthoughtcomproductscanopywebsitewwwenthoughtcom accessdate20 August 2016ref

 Implementations

 Reference implementation 
CPython is the reference implementation of Python It is written in C programming languageC meeting the C89 C versionC89 standard with several select C99 featuresref nameAutoNT66  It compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecoderef nameAutoNT67  which is then executed by its virtual machineref nameAutoNT68  CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python It is available for many platforms including Microsoft WindowsWindows and most modern Unixlike systems Platform portability was one of its earliest prioritiesref nameAutoNT69 

 Other implementations 
PyPy is a fast compliantref nameAutoNT70  interpreter of Python 27 and 35 Its Justintime compilationjustintime compiler brings a significant speed improvement over CPythonref nameAutoNT71 

Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads it does not use the C memory stack thus allowing massively concurrent programs PyPy also has a stackless versionref nameAutoNT73 

MicroPython is a Python 3 variant optimised for microcontrollers

 Unsupported implementations 
Other justintime Python compilers have been developed but are now unsupported

 Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009 with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter fivefold by using the LLVM and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of coresref nameAutoNT74 
 Psyco is a Justintime compilationjustintime Runtime algorithm specialisationspecialising compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime The emitted code is specialised for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code

In 2005 Nokia released a Python interpreter for the Series 60 mobile phones named PyS60 It includes many of the modules from the CPython implementations and some additional modules to integrate with the Symbian operating system The project has been kept uptodate to run on all variants of the S60 platform and several thirdparty modules are available The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries enabling programs to be written and run on the target devicerefcite web titlePython on the Nokia N900 urlhttpwwwstochasticgeometryie20100429pythononthenokian900websiteStochastic Geometryref

 Crosscompilers to other languages 
There are several compilers to highlevel object languages with either unrestricted Python a restricted subset of Python or a language similar to Python as the source language
 Jython compiles into Java byte code which can then be executed by every Java virtual machine implementation This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program
 IronPython follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the NET Common Language Runtime
 The RPython language can be compiled to C programming languageC Java bytecode or Common Intermediate Language and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python
 Pyjs compiles Python to JavaScript
 Cython compiles Python to C programming languageC and C
 Pythran compiles Python to C
 Somewhat dated Pyrex programming languagePyrex latest release in 2010 and Shed Skin latest release in 2013 compile to C and C respectively

 Development 
Pythons development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal PEP process the primary mechanism for proposing major new features collecting community input on issues and documenting Python design decisionsref namePepCite000  Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and Guido Van Rossum Pythons Benevolent Dictator For Liferef namePepCite000 

Enhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation The mailing list pythondev is the primary forum for the languages development Specific issues are discussed in the Roundup issue trackerRoundup bug tracker maintained at pythonorgref nameAutoNT21  Development originally took place on a selfhosted sourcecode repository running Mercurial until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017ref namepydevguidecite web titlePython Developers Guide urlhttpsdocspythonorgdevguideref

CPythons public releases come in three types distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented

 Backwardincompatible versions where code is expected to break and need to be manually ported The first part of the version number is incremented These releases happen infrequentlyfor example version 30 was released 8 years after 20
 Major or feature releases about every 18 months are largely compatible but introduce new features The second part of the version number is incremented Each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its releaseref namereleaseschedule 
 Bugfix releases which introduce no new features occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases The third and final part of the version number is incrementedref nameAutoNT22 

Many beta releasealpha beta and releasecandidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases Although there is a rough schedule for each release they are often delayed if the code is not ready Pythons development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development and using the BuildBot continuous integration systemref nameAutoNT23

 Further reading 
 THIS IS NOT A LIST OF ALL PYTHON BOOKS
According to WikipediaFurther reading criteria for inclusion includes
1 Should clearly qualify as WPRS as indicated by reviews and citations to it

5 There should be guidelines on limiting the number of sources
6 To avoid spam any book included should have received more than one good review in RS newspapers and scholarly journals being the norm and the clear balance of RS reviews should be positive This would avoid selfpublish spamming POV pushing and attempts by publishers to get books promoted through inclusion on Wikipedia At the moment editorial recommendations as described in the manual smacks of OR
7 Neutrality on the part of editors is essential In terms of major debates items representing all major positions should be included with annotations indicating the specific POV of each We may have to work out rules where topic disputes are irreconcilable
