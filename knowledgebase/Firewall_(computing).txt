Computer security
In computing a firewall is a network security system that Network monitoringmonitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rulesrefcite book  first1Noureddine  last1Boudriga  titleSecurity of mobile communications  publisherCRC Press  date2010  locationBoca Raton  pages3233  isbn0849379423ref A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network such as the Internetref nameOppliger 1997 94cite journallastOppligerfirstRolftitleInternet Security FIREWALLS and BEYONDjournalCommunications of the ACMdateMay 1997volume40issue5page94doi101145253769253802ref

Firewalls are often categorized as either network firewalls or hostbased firewalls Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware Hostbased firewalls run on host computers and control network traffic in and out of those machines

The key benefit of application layer firewallapplication layer filtering is that it can understand certain applications and protocols such as File Transfer Protocol FTP Domain Name System DNS or Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP This is useful as it is able to detect if an unwanted application or service is attempting to bypass the firewall using a protocol on an allowed List of TCP and UDP port numbersport or detect if a protocol is being abused in any harmful way

As of 2012 the socalled NextGeneration Firewallnextgeneration firewall NGFW is nothing more than the wider or deeper inspection at application stack For example the existing deep packet inspection functionality of modern firewalls can be extended to include

 Network layer or packet filters 
Network layer firewalls also called packet filters operate at a relatively low level of the Internet protocol suiteTCPIP protocol stack not allowing packets to pass through the firewall unless they match the established rule set The firewall administrator may define the rules or default rules may apply The term packet filter originated in the context of BSD operating systems

Network layer firewalls generally fall into two subcategories stateful firewallstateful and stateless firewallstateless

 Applicationlayer 
Main articleApplication layer firewall

Applicationlayer firewalls work on the application level of the Internet protocol suiteKey architectural principlesTCPIP stack ie all browser traffic or all telnet or FTP traffic and may intercept all packets traveling to or from an application

Application firewalls function by determining whether a process should accept any given connection Application firewalls accomplish their function by hooking into socket calls to filter the connections between the application layer and the lower layers of the OSI model Application firewalls that hook into socket calls are also referred to as socket filters Application firewalls work much like a packet filter but application filters apply filtering rules allowblock on a per process basis instead of filtering connections on a per port basis Generally prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection It is rare to find application firewalls not combined or used in conjunction with a packet filterrefcite weburlhttpwwwsymanteccomconnectarticlessoftwarefirewallsmadestrawpart12 titleSoftware Firewalls Made of Straw Part 1 of 2 publisherSymantec Connect Community date20100629 accessdate20140328ref

Also application firewalls further filter connections by examining the process ID of data packets against a rule set for the local process involved in the data transmission The extent of the filtering that occurs is defined by the provided rule set Given the variety of software that exists application firewalls only have more complex rule sets for the standard services such as sharing services These perprocess rule sets have limited efficacy in filtering every possible association that may occur with other processes Also these perprocess rule sets cannot defend against modification of the process via exploitation such as memory corruption exploits Because of these limitations application firewalls are beginning to be supplanted by a new generation of application firewalls that rely on mandatory access control MAC also referred to as Sandbox computer securitysandboxing to protect vulnerable servicesrefcite weburlhttphelpcomodocomtopic7214514846html title Auto Sandboxing publisherComodo Inc accessdate20140828ref

 Proxies 
Main articleProxy server

A proxy server running either on dedicated hardware or as software on a generalpurpose machine may act as a firewall by responding to input packets connection requests for example in the manner of an application while blocking other packets A proxy server is a gateway from one network to another for a specific network application in the sense that it functions as a proxy on behalf of the network userref nameOppliger 1997 94

Proxies make tampering with an internal system from the external network more difficult so that misuse of one internal system would not necessarily cause a security breach exploitable from outside the Redblack conceptfirewall as long as the application proxy remains intact and properly configured Conversely intruders may hijack a publicly reachable system and use it as a proxy for their own purposes the proxy then Spoofing attackmasquerades as that system to other internal machines While use of internal address spaces enhances security security crackingcrackers may still employ methods such as IP spoofing to attempt to pass packets to a target network

 Network address translation 
Main articleNetwork address translation
Firewalls often have network address translation NAT functionality and the hosts protected behind a firewall commonly have addresses in the private address range as defined in RFC 1918 Firewalls often have such functionality to hide the true address of computer which is connected to the network Originally the NAT function was developed to address the limited number of IPv4 routable addresses that could be used or assigned to companies or individuals as well as reduce both the amount and therefore cost of obtaining enough public addresses for every computer in an organization Although NAT on its own is not considered a security feature hiding the addresses of protected devices has become an often used defense against Vulnerability scannernetwork reconnaissancerefcite weburlhttpstechnetmicrosoftcomenuslibraryhh831365aspx title Advanced Security Firewall publisherMicrosoft accessdate20140828ref
