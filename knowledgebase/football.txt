 Establishment of modern codes 

 English public schools 
MainEnglish public school football games
While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain its public school Englandpublic schools known as private schools in other countries are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes First of all the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its mob form and turning it into an organised team sport Second many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools Third it was teachers students and former students from these schools who first codified football games to enable matches to be played between schools Finally it was at English public schools that the division between kicking and running or carrying games first became clear

The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools  mainly attended by boys from the upper uppermiddle and professional classes  comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519 Herman had been headmaster at Eton CollegeEton and Winchester CollegeWinchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase We wyll playe with a ball full of wynderefA history of Winchester College by Arthur F Leach Duckworth 1899 ISBN1444658840ref

During the early 19th century most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week often for over twelve hours a day They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and at the time many Child labourIndustrial Revolutionchildren were part of the labour force Feast day football played on the streets was in decline Public school boys who enjoyed some freedom from work became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules

Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit Each school drafted its own rules which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils Two schools of thought developed regarding rules Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried as at Rugby Marlborough CollegeMarlborough and Cheltenham while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted as at Eton Harrow Westminster SchoolWestminster and Charterhouse SchoolCharterhouse The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played For example Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running gamesCitation neededdateJune 2009reasonFor the whole paragraph

Railway ManiaThe boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before Interschool sporting competitions became possible However it was difficult for schools to play each other at football as each school played by its own rules The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves one half played by the rules of the host home school and the other half by the visiting away school

During the early 1860s there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games In 1862 J C Thring who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called The Simplest Game these are also known as the Uppingham Rules In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow Shrewsbury Eton Rugby Marlborough and Westminster

At the Freemasons Tavern Great Queen Street London on the evening of October 26 1863 representatives of several football clubs in the County of LondonLondon Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association FA The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members Following the first meeting the public schools were invited to join the association All of them declined except Charterhouse and Uppingham In total six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863 After the third meeting a draft set of rules were published However at the beginning of the fourth meeting attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863 The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas namely running with carrying the ball and hacking rugbyhacking kicking opposing players in the shins The two contentious FA rules were as follows

quoteIX A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries goal if he makes a fair catch or catches the ball on the first bound but in case of a fair catch if he makes his mark he shall not runbr Leave it here two rules two lines 
X If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries goal any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge hold trip or hack him or to wrest the ball from him but no player shall be held and hacked at the same timerefPeter Shortell httpclubsrfucomClubsportalscornwallrefereesThoughtsforRefs6667aspx  Hacking  a history webarchiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20080403122555httpclubsrfucomClubsportalscornwallrefereesThoughtsforRefs6667aspx date20080403  httpclubsrfucomClubsportalscornwallrefereesCRRSHistory6515aspx Cornwall Referees Society  webarchiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20080303044805httpclubsrfucomClubsportalscornwallrefereesCRRSHistory6515aspx dateMarch 3 2008  2 October 2006ref

At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed Most of the delegates supported this but F M Campbell the representative from Blackheath Rugby ClubBlackheath and the first FA treasurer objected He said hacking is the true football However the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA After the final meeting on 8 December the FA published the Laws of the Game association footballLaws of Football the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football The term soccer in use since the late 19th century derives from an Oxford erOxford University abbreviation of Associationref nameOEDsoccercite journal dateJune 2011 titlesoccer n journalOxford English Dictionary volume issue pages urlhttpwwwoedcomviewEntry183733 accessdateJuly 1 2011ref

There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association GAA in 1884 The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on February 7 1887 Davins rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule an attribute which for many years was shared only by other Irish games like hurling and by Australian rules football

The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better spectator sport Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU most notably with the abolition of the lineout rugby unionlineout This was followed by the replacement of the Playing rugby unionRuckruck with the playtheball ruck which allowed a twoplayer ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled Rugby union gameplayMaulMauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held being replaced by a playthe ballruck The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901 forming the Northern Rugby League the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England

Over time the RFU form of rugby played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB became known as rugby union

 Globalisation of association football 
MainHistory of FIFA
The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body but was perceived as making no progress It fell to associations from seven other European countries France Belgium Denmark Netherlands Spain Sweden and Switzerland to form an international association The Fédération Internationale de Football Association FIFA was founded in Paris on May 21 1904 Its first president was Robert Guérin The French name and acronym has remained even outside Frenchspeaking countries

 Further divergence of the two rugby codes 
Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906 with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players In 1907 a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain receiving an enthusiastic response and professional rugby league in Australiarugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year However the rules of professional games varied from one country to another and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match This situation endured until 1948 when at the instigation of the French league the Rugby League International Federation RLIF was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux

During the second half of the 20th century the rules changed further In 1966 rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of Down footballdowns a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six in 1971 and in rugby league this became known as the Playing rugby leagueSix tackle rulesix tackle rule

With the advent of fulltime professionals in the early 1990s and the consequent speeding up of the game the five metre offside distance between the two teams became 10nbspmetres and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules among other changes

The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century although less significantly than those of rugby league In particular goals from mark rugbymarks were abolished kicks directly Touch rugbyinto touch from outside the Rugby pitch22 metre line were penalised new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive Ruck Rugby unionruck or Rugby union gameplayMaulmaul and the lifting of players in lineout rugby unionlineouts was legalised

In 1995 rugby union became an open game that is one which allowed professional playersrefcite web titleHistory of the RFU urlhttpwwwrfucomAboutTheRFUHistoryaspx workRugby Football UnionRFU accessdate28 September 2011 deadurlyes archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20100422210444httpwwwrfucomAboutTheRFUHistoryaspx archivedate22 April 2010ref Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared  and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of reunification  the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future

 Use of the word football 
detailsFootball word
The word football when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above Because of this much friendly controversy has occurred over the term football primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the Englishspeaking world Most often the word football is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region So effectively what the word football means usually depends on where one says it

FileFootball crossjpgthumbPlayers assemble at the line of scrimmage in an American football game
In each of the United Kingdom the United States and Canada one football code is known solely as football while the others generally require a qualifier In New Zealand football historically referred to rugby union but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football The sport meant by the word football in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league depending on popularity which largely conforms to what has been called the Barassi Line In francophone Quebec where Canadian football is more popular the Canadian code is known as football while American football is known as langfrFootball américain and association football is known as langfrle soccerrefcite web urlhttpwwwfederationsoccerqccaindexphpoptioncomcontentviewarticleid149Itemid34 titleThe governing body is the Fédération de soccer du Québec publisherFederationsoccerqcca date accessdate20120416 deadurlyes archiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20120304192131httpwwwfederationsoccerqccaindexphpoptioncomcontentviewarticleid149Itemid34 archivedate20120304 dfref Of the 45 national FIFA Fédération Internationale de Football Association affiliates in which English is an official or primary language most currently use Football in their organisations official names the FIFA affiliates in Canadian Soccer AssociationCanada and the United States Soccer FederationUnited States use Soccer in their names A few FIFA affiliates have recently normalised to using Football including
