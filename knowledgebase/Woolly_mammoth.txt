The woolly mammoth Mammuthus primigenius is an extinct species of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch and was one of the last in a line of mammoth species beginning with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene The woolly mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400000 years ago in East Asia Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any Prehistoryprehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska as well as skeletons teeth stomach contents dung and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796

The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern African elephants Males reached shoulder heights between convert27and34mft1abbron and weighed up to convert6MTST Females reached convert2629mft1abbron in shoulder heights and weighed up to convert4MTST A newborn calf weighed about convert90kglb The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the Last glacial periodlast ice age It was covered in fur with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat The colour of the coat animalcoat varied from dark to light The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss It had long curved tusks and four Molar toothmolars which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects fighting and foraging The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and Cyperaceaesedges Individuals could probably reach the age of 60 Its habitat was the mammoth steppe which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America

The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans who used its bones and tusks for making art tools and dwellings and the species was also hunted for food It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10000 years ago most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat hunting by humans or a combination of the two Isolated populations survived on Saint Paul Island AlaskaSt Paul Island until 5600 years ago and on Wrangel Island until 4000 years ago After its extinction humans continued using its ivory as a raw material a tradition that continues today It has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means but none of these are yet feasible

Adult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks trunks and size but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves cave hyenas and large felidaefelines The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting such as Territory animalterritorial fights or fights over mates Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females and to intimidate rivals Because of their curvature the tusks were not suitable for stabbing but may have been used for hitting as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail enabling its use as a flyswatter similar to the tail on modern elephants As in modern elephants the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limblike organ with many functions It was used for manipulating objects and in social interactionsrefLister 2007 ppnbsp95105ref The wellpreserved foot of the adult male Yukagir mammoth shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion Like modern elephants woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large fleshy pads behind the toesref nameLister 2007 82 87

Like modern elephants woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in matriarchal femaleled family groups This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups It is therefore probable that most of their other social behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants It is unknown how many mammoths lived at one location at a time as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time It is likely that the amounts varied by season and lifecycle events Modern elephants can form large herds sometimes consisting of multiple family groups and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together Mammoths may have formed large herds more often since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areasrefLister 2007 ppnbsp6263ref Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 1130011000 years ago have been found in the St Mary Reservoir in Canada showing that there were in this case almost equal numbers of adults subadults and juveniles The adults had a stride of convert2mftabbron and the juveniles ran to keep upref nameTrackway

In a 2015 study highquality genome sequences from three Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared Approximately 14 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants which affect the sequence of more than 1600 proteins Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival including development of skin and hair storage and metabolism of adipose tissue and perceiving temperature Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered One of the heatsensing genes encodes a protein TRPV3 found in skin which also affects hair growth When inserted into human cells the mammoths version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephants This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice and have wavier hair There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals such as reindeerref nameLynch2015Cite journal  doi  101016jcelrep201506027 title  Elephantid genomes reveal the molecular bases of Woolly Mammoth adaptations to the arctic year  2015 last1  Lynch  first1  V  last2  BedoyaReina  first2  O C  last3  Ratan  first3  A  last4  Sulak  first4  M  last5  DrautzMoses  first5  D I  last6  Perry  first6  G H  last7  Miller  first7  W  last8  Schuster  first8  S CjournalCell Reportsvolume12issue2pages217228refref nameCallaway2015cite weburlhttpwwwscientificamericancomarticlemammothgenomesproviderecipeforcreatingarcticelephantstitleMammoth Genomes Provide Recipe for Creating Arctic Elephantsdate20150504authorEwen Callaway Nature magazineworkscientificamericancomdeadurlnoarchiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20150505135155httpwwwscientificamericancomarticlemammothgenomesproviderecipeforcreatingarcticelephantsarchivedate5 May 2015dfdmyallref

Life history
FileMammoth tusk slicejpgthumbleftCross sectioned tusk with growth rings
The lifespan of mammals is related to their size and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths which were of a similar size The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section but this does not account for their early years as these are represented by the tips of the tusks which are usually worn away In the remaining part of the tusk each major line represents a year and weekly and daily ones can be found in between Dark bands correspond to summers and it is therefore possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died The growth of the tusks slowed when it became harder to forage for example during winter during disease or when a male was banished from the herd male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 2520000 years ago show slower growth rates Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood like other elephants Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40 and females grew until they were 25 The frozen calf Dima was convert90cminabbron tall when it died at the age of 612 months At this age the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age The third set of molars lasted for ten years and this process was repeated until the final sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old When the last set of molars was worn out the animal would be unable to chew and feed and it would die of starvation A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring the hardest times for northern animals to surviverefLister 2007 ppnbsp83107refref nameHerbert2010cite web  url  httpshelixnorthwesterneduarticlemammothfindcluespastpresentandfuture  title  A Mammoth Find Clues to the Past Present and Future  last  Herbert  first  B  last2  Fisher  first2  D  date  20100505  website  Helix  publisher  Northwestern University  accessdate  20160801  deadurl  no  archiveurl  httpswebarchiveorgweb20160818074348httpshelixnorthwesterneduarticlemammothfindcluespastpresentandfuture  archivedate  18 August 2016  df  dmyall ref

The habitat of the woolly mammoth is known as mammoth steppe or tundra steppe This environment stretched across northern Asia many parts of Europe and the northern part of North America during the last ice age It was similar to the grassy steppes of modern Russia but the flora was more diverse abundant and grew faster Grasses sedges shrubs and herbaceous plants were present and scattered trees were mainly found in southern regions This habitat was not dominated by ice and snow as is popularly believed since these regions are thought to have been highpressure areas at the time The habitat of the woolly mammoth also supported other grazing herbivores such as the woolly rhinoceros Equus genuswild horses and bisonref nameLister 2007 pp 8889Lister 2007 ppnbsp8889ref A 2014 study concluded that forbs a group of herbaceous plants were more important in the steppetundra than previously acknowledged and that it was a primary food source for the iceage megafaunarefCite journal  doi  101038nature12921 title  Fifty thousand years of Arctic vegetation and megafaunal diet journal  Nature volume  506 issue  7486 pages  4751 year  2014 last1  Willerslev  first1  E  last2  Davison  first2  J  last3  Moora  first3  M  last4  Zobel  first4  M  last5  Coissac  first5  E  last6  Edwards  first6  M E  last7  Lorenzen  first7  E D  last8  Vestergård  first8  M  last9  Gussarova  first9  G  last10  Haile  first10  J  last11  Craine  first11  J  last12  Gielly  first12  L  last13  Boessenkool  first13  S  last14  Epp  first14  L S  last15  Pearman  first15  P B  last16  Cheddadi  first16  R  last17  Murray  first17  D  last18  Bråthen  first18  K A  last19  Yoccoz  first19  N  last20  Binney  first20  H  last21  Cruaud  first21  C  last22  Wincker  first22  P  last23  Goslar  first23  T  last24  Alsos  first24  I G  last25  Bellemain  first25  E  last26  Brysting  first26  A K  last27  Elven  first27  R  last28  Sønstebø  first28  J R H  last29  Murton  first29  J  last30  Sher  first30  A  displayauthors  29  pmid24499916 bibcode  2014Natur50647Wref

Relationship with humans
FilePSM V01 D225 Ivory fossiljpgthumbleftWoolly mammoth carved in ivory discovered by Édouard Lartet in 1864
Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths during the Upper Palaeolithic period when the humans entered Europe from Africa between 30000 and 40000 years ago Before this Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic and already utilised mammoth bones for tool making and building materials Woolly mammoths were very important to iceage humans and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823 which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries In 1864 Édouard Lartet found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne France The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern sciencerefLister 2007 ppnbsp116117ref

The woolly mammoth is the third most depicted animal in iceage art after horses and bison and these images were produced between 35000 and 11500 years ago Today more than five hundred depictions of woolly mammoths are known in media ranging from cave paintings and engravings on the walls of 46 caves in Russia France and Spain to engravings and sculptures termed portable art made from ivory antler stone and bone Cave paintings of woolly mammoths exist in several styles and sizes The French Rouffignac Cave has the most depictions 159 and some of the drawings are more than convert2mft in length Other notable caves with mammoth depictions are the Chauvet Cave Les Combarelles Cave and FontdeGaumeref nameLister 2007 118 125Lister 2007 ppnbsp118125ref A depiction in the Cave of El Castillo may instead show Palaeoloxodon the straighttusked elephantref nameartCite journal  last1  Braun  first1  I M  last2  Palombo  first2  M R  doi  101016jquaint201207010  title  Mammuthus primigenius in the cave and portable art An overview with a short account on the elephant fossil record in Southern Europe during the last glacial  journal  Quaternary International  volume  276277  pages  6176  year  2012  pmid    pmc   bibcode  2012QuInt27661B ref

Portable art can be more accurately dated than cave art since it is found in the same deposits as tools and other ice age artefacts The largest collection of portable mammoth art consisting of 62 depictions on 47 plaques was found in the 1960s at an excavated openair camp near Gönnersdorf in Germany There does not seem to be a correlation between the number of mammoths depicted and the species that were most often hunted since reindeer bones are the most frequently found animal remains at the site Two spear throwers shaped as woolly mammoths have also been found in Franceref nameLister 2007 118 125 Some portable mammoth depictions may not have been produced where they were discovered but could have moved around by ancient tradingref nameart

Woolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects Several Venus figurines including the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue were made from this material Weapons made from ivory such as daggers spears and a boomerang are also known To be able to process the ivory the large tusks had to be chopped chiselled and split into smaller more manageable pieces Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened and it is unknown how this was achievedrefLister 2007 ppnbsp131137ref

Several woolly mammoth specimens show evidence of being butchered by humans which is indicated by breaks cutmarks and associated stone tools It is not known how much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat since there were many other large herbivores available Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps Few specimens show direct unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans A Siberian specimen with a spearhead embedded in its shoulder blade shows that a spear had been thrown at it with great forcerefLister 2007 ppnbsp151155ref A specimen from the Mousterian age of Italy shows evidence of spear hunting by NeanderthalsrefCite journal  last1  Mussi  first1  M  last2  Villa  first2  P  doi  101016jjas200804014  title  Single carcass of Mammuthus primigenius with lithic artifacts in the Upper Pleistocene of northern Italy  journal  Journal of Archaeological Science  volume  35  issue  9  pages  26062613  year  2008  pmid    pmc  ref  The juvenile specimen nicknamed Yuka is the first frozen mammoth with evidence of human interaction It shows evidence of having been killed by a large predator and of having been scavenged by humans shortly after Some of its bones had been removed and were found nearbyref namebbcyuka A site near the Yana River in Siberia has revealed several specimens with evidence of human hunting but the finds were interpreted to show that the animals were not hunted intensively but perhaps mainly when ivory was neededrefCite journal  last1  Nikolskiy  first1  P  last2  Pitulko  first2  V  doi  101016jjas201305020  title  Evidence from the Yana Palaeolithic site Arctic Siberia yields clues to the riddle of mammoth hunting  journal  Journal of Archaeological Science  volume  40  issue  12  pages  41894197  year  2013  pmid    pmc  ref Two woolly mammoths from Wisconsin the Schaefer and Hebior mammoths show evidence of having been butchered by PalaeoamericansrefCite journal  doi  101002gea10052 title  Geoarchaeological contexts for Late Pleistocene archaeological sites with humanmodified woolly mammoth remains in southeastern Wisconsin USA journal  Geoarchaeology volume  18 pages  91114 year  2003 last1  Overstreet  first1  D F  last2  Kolb  first2  M F refrefCite journal  doi  101016jquaint200503004 title  Chronology and new research on the Schaefer mammoth Mammuthus primigenius site Kenosha County Wisconsin USA journal  Quaternary International volume  142143 pages  4457 year  2006 last1  Joyce  first1  D J  bibcode  2006QuInt14244Jref

Extinction

Most woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna including the Columbian mammoth This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event which began 40000 years ago and peaked between 14000 and 11500 years ago Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change which led to the shrinkage of its habitat was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth or whether it was due to a combination of the two Whatever the cause large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range but gradually became extinct over time Most populations disappeared between 14000 and 10000 years ago The last mainland population existed in the Chaunsky DistrictKyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9650 years agorefLister 2007 ppnbsp146148refrefCite journal  last1  Stuart  first1  A J  last2  Sulerzhitsky  first2  L D  last3  Orlova  first3  L A  last4  Kuzmin  first4  Y V  last5  Lister  first5  A M  title  The latest woolly mammoths Mammuthus primigenius Blumenbach in Europe and Asia A review of the current evidence  doi  101016S0277379102000264  journal  Quaternary Science Reviews  volume  21  issue  1415  pages  15591569  year  2002  pmid    pmc   bibcode  2002QSRv211559S ref A small population of woolly mammoths survived on Saint Paul Island AlaskaSt Paul Island Alaska well into the Holoceneref nameGuthrieCite journal  last1  Dale Guthrie  first1  R  title  Radiocarbon evidence of midHolocene mammoths stranded on an Alaskan Bering Sea island  doi  101038nature02612  journal  Nature  volume  429  issue  6993  pages  746749  year  2004  pmid   15201907 pmc   bibcode  2004Natur429746D refrefCite journal last1  Yesner first1  D R last2  Veltre first2  D W last3  Crossen first3  K J last4  Graham first4  R W  title  5700yearold Mammoth Remains from Qagnax Cave Pribilof Islands Alaska  journal  Second World of Elephants Congress Hot Springs Mammoth Site 2005  pages  200203refrefCite journal  last  Crossen  first  K S  title  5700YearOld Mammoth Remains from the Pribilof Islands Alaska Last Outpost of North America Megafauna  journal  Geological Society of America  volume  37  page  463  year  2005  url  httpsgsaconfexcomgsa2005AMfinalprogramabstract97313htm  deadurl  no  archiveurl  httpswebarchiveorgweb20140407085600httpsgsaconfexcomgsa2005AMfinalprogramabstract97313htm  archivedate  7 April 2014  df  dmyall ref with the most recently published date of extinction being 5600 years BPref nameGraham2016  The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4000 years ago well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of GizaGreat Pyramid of ancient Egyptrefcite weburlhttpwwwheritagedailycom201311mammothsstillwalkedtheearthwhenthegreatpyramidswerebeingbuilt100307titleMammoths still walked the earth when the Great Pyramid was being builtauthorMarkus MilliganworkHeritageDaily  Heritage  Archaeology Newsaccessdate5 July 2015deadurlyesarchiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20150630060405httpwwwheritagedailycom201311mammothsstillwalkedtheearthwhenthegreatpyramidswerebeingbuilt100307archivedate30 June 2015dfdmyallrefrefCite journal  last1  Stuart  first1  A J  last2  Kosintsev  first2  P A  last3  Higham  first3  T F G  last4  Lister  first4  A M  title  Pleistocene to Holocene extinction dynamics in giant deer and woolly mammoth  doi  101038nature02890  journal  Nature  volume  431  issue  7009  pages  684689  year  2004  pmid   15470427 pmc   bibcode  2004Natur431684S refref nameVartanyan1995cite journal  last  Vartanyan  first  S L  year  1995  title  Radiocarbon Dating Evidence for Mammoths on Wrangel Island Arctic Ocean until 2000 BC  journal  Radiocarbon  volume  37  issue  1  pages  16  issn  00338222  url  httpsjournalsuairarizonaeduindexphpradiocarbonarticleview16401644  displayauthors  etal  deadurl  no  archiveurl  httpswebarchiveorgweb20120402103117httpsjournalsuairarizonaeduindexphpradiocarbonarticleview16401644  archivedate  2 April 2012  df  dmyall refref name  Nyström2012Cite journal  last1  Nyström  first1  V  last2  Humphrey  first2  J  last3  Skoglund  first3  P  last4  McKeown  first4  N J  last5  Vartanyan  first5  S  last6  Shaw  first6  P W  last7  Lidén  first7  K  last8  Jakobsson  first8  M  last9  Barnes  first9  I A N  last10  Angerbjörn  doi  101111j1365294X201205525x  first10  A  last11  Lister  first11  A  last12  Dalén  first12  L  title  Microsatellite genotyping reveals endPleistocene decline in mammoth autosomal genetic variation  journal  Molecular Ecology  volume  21  issue  14  pages  33913402  year  2012  pmid   22443459 pmc  ref

Woolly mammoth fossils have been found in many different types of deposits including former rivers and lakes and also in Doggerland in the North Sea which was dry at times during the ice age Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed elephants graveyards as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found it is thought these are the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time perhaps due to flooding Natural traps such as kettle holes sink holes as well as mud have also trapped mammoths in separate events over timeref nameLister 2007 45 75

Apart from frozen remains the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a petroleum seep in Starunia Poland Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of Siberia and Alaska with far fewer finds in the latter Such remains are mostly found above the Arctic Circle in permafrost It appears that soft tissue was less likely to be preserved between 30000 and 15000 years ago perhaps because the climate was milder during that period Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery due to exposure or to being scavenged This natural mummification required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt mud and icy water which then frozerefLister 2007 ppnbsp5051ref

Siberian mammoth ivory is reported to have been exported to Russia and Europe in the 10th century The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611 When Russia occupied Siberia the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity with huge amounts being excavated From the 19th century and onwards woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity used as raw material for many products Today it is still in great demand as a replacement for the nowbanned export of elephant ivory and has been referred to as white gold Local dealers estimate that there are 10 million mammoths still frozen in Siberia and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths the demand could instead be met by these Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 Lausanne Conference but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory but the former is browner and the Schreger lines are coarser in texturerefLister 2007 ppnbsp137139ref In the 21st century global warming has made access to Siberian tusks easier since the permafrost thaws more quickly exposing the mammoths embedded within itref nameLarmer2015cite weburlhttpngmnationalgeographiccom201304mammothtuskslarmertexttitleMammoth Tusk HuntersworknationalgeographiccomdateApril 2013lastLarmerfirstBdeadurlnoarchiveurlhttpswebarchiveorgweb20130402004219httpngmnationalgeographiccom201304mammothtuskslarmertextarchivedate2 April 2013dfdmyallref

Stories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted especially that of the Berezovka mammoth but most of these are considered dubious The carcasses were in most cases decayed and the stench so unbearable that only wild scavengers and the dogs accompanying the finders showed any interest in the flesh It appears that such meat was once recommended against illness in China and Siberian natives have occasionally cooked the meat of frozen carcasses they discoveredrefLister 2007 p 54ref

Alleged survival
There have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not extinct and that small isolated herds might survive in the vast and sparsely inhabited tundra of the Northern Hemisphere In the 19th century several reports of large shaggy beasts were passed on to the Russian authorities by Siberian tribesmen but no scientific proof ever surfaced A French chargé daffaires working in Vladivostok M Gallon said in 1946 that in 1920 he had met a Russian furtrapper who claimed to have seen living giant furry elephants deep into the taiga Gallon added that the furtrapper had not heard of mammoths beforeref nameSjögren1962 Due to the large area of Siberia it cannot be completely ruled out that woolly mammoths survived into more recent times but all evidence indicates that they became extinct thousands of years ago It is likely that these natives had gained their knowledge of woolly mammoths from carcasses they encountered and that this is the source for their legends of the animalrefLister 2007 p 55ref
