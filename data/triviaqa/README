The download script does the following:
* downloads and unpacks triviaqa
* clones github.com/allenai/document-qa temporarily (third party)
* preprocesses triviaqa with third party
* converts datasets from third-party to Jack format while sub-sampling supporting paragraphs using tf-idf following [1]

You can set parallelism with with the first argument to download script and the download dir of triviaqa
with the 2nd argument. Try to use an SSD to speed up things. The whole setup can take a few hours.
