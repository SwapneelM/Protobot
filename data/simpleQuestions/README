Note that the full context for all questions are the triples in the subfolder freebase-subsets.
The exact triples selected as full context for each question are not distributed, only the Freebase triple the question was based on.
From this triple, the full context can be looked up.
Therefore the conversion script only converts the subject and rel of the triple as context.
See the paper [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02075v1.pdf] for how the full context for each question is obtained.
