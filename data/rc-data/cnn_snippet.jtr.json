        "text": "( @entity0 ) -- each summer , @entity1 greets a stampede of sightseers and shoppers with eager cash registers . before jumping into the peak - season pig pile , consider the advantages of an off - season trip . major cities like @entity10 crackle with energy year - round . given the current weakness of our dollar overseas , the potential price - savings of an off - season trip are enough to brighten a gray winter day . airfares are often hundreds of dollars less . with fewer crowds in @entity1 , you 'll sleep cheaper . many fine hotels drop their prices , and budget hotels have plenty of vacancies . to save some money on hotels in the off - season , arrive late without a reservation , notice how many empty rooms they have ( look for keys on the rack ) , and give the receptionist an excuse to win your business with a deep discount . explain that you 're a senior ( hosteller , student , artist , whatever ) with a particular price limit , and bargain from there . note that while tourist - oriented places may be cheaper in the low season , the opposite is true of big - city business centers ( especially @entity47 and the @entity49 capitals ) , which are busiest and most expensive in the off - season . for many travelers , \" shoulder season \" -- april , may , early june , september and early october -- offers the best mix of peak - season and off - season pros and cons. in shoulder season you 'll enjoy decent weather , long days , fewer crowds and a local tourist industry that is still eager to please and entertain . outside of peak season , adventurers loiter all alone through @entity63 's home , ponder un-pestered in @entity65 's @entity64 , kick up sand on virgin beaches and chat with laid - back guards by log fires in @entity71 chateaux . in wintertime @entity72 you can be alone atop @entity74 bell tower , watching the clouds of your breath roll over the @entity78 domes of the church to a horizon of cut - glass @entity81 . below , on @entity83 , hungry pigeons fidget and wonder , \" where are the tourists ? \" without the crowds , you can enjoy step - right - up service at tourist offices and experience a more @entity1 . although many popular tourist - oriented parks , shows and tours will be closed , off - season is in - season for the high culture : plays and operas are in their crowd - pleasing glory . for instance , in @entity101 , while the @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 are scarce in the summer , all have a busy schedule of performances through the rest of the year . @entity1 's major cities crackle with energy year - round . in @entity108 , you can spend your days at the @entity109 and @entity110 , and your nights at a cozy pub or a world - class play . in @entity10 -- the @entity10 that always sparkles -- you can get face - to - face with @entity117 and scale the @entity118 . in @entity119 , you 'll see @entity121 paintings and @entity122 without peak - season crowds . but winter travel has its drawbacks . because much of @entity1 is in @entity127 latitudes , the days are short . it 's dark by 5 p.m. the weather can be miserable -- cold , windy , and drizzly -- and then turn worse . but just as summer can be wet and gray , winter can be crisp and blue , and even into mid-november , hillsides blaze with colorful leaves . to thrive in the winter , you 'll need to get the most out of your limited daylight hours . start early and eat a quick lunch . pack for the cold and wet -- layers , rainproof parka , gloves , wool hat , long johns , waterproof shoes and an umbrella . use undershirts to limit the washing of slow - drying heavy shirts . dress warmly . cold weather is colder when you 're outdoors trying to enjoy yourself all day long . and cheap hotels are not always adequately heated in the off - season . off - season hours are limited . tourist information offices normally stay open year - round but have shorter hours in the winter . while most sights stay open through the winter , they typically operate on shorter schedules ( such as 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. rather than 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. ) , with darkness often determining the closing time . winter sightseeing is fine in big cities , which bustle year - round , but it 's more frustrating in small tourist towns , which often close down entirely . in december many beach resorts are shut up as tight as canned hams . while @entity1 's wonderful outdoor evening ambience survives year - round in the south , wintertime streets are empty in the north after dark . english - language tours , common in the summer , are rare during the off - season , when most visitors are natives . another disadvantage of winter travel is loneliness . the solo traveler wo n't have the built - in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season . still , this can be a plus , since it encourages you to really connect with the locals you traveled halfway around the world to meet . regardless of when you go , if your objective is to \" meet the people , \" you 'll find @entity1 filled with them 365 days a year . @entity192 writes @entity1 travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio . e-mail him at @entity198 , or write to him c / o @entity199 2009 , @entity200 , @entity201 . 98020 . copyright 2007 @entity192 , @entity202 , @entity204 e-mail to a friend"

\" @entity3 asked . @entity16 responded : \" yes . \" \" i have no more questions , \" @entity3 said . for his part , @entity3 has said little during the death penalty trial , other than to say he was the shooter . but on monday , @entity3 appeared to be casting doubt on @entity16 's testimony that he shot a wounded , unarmed female police officer . the officer earlier testified that after @entity3 shot her , he kicked her weapon out of her reach . @entity3 has left no doubt about his role , telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement : \" the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter . \" he 's also left little question about why he did it , repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect @entity49 leaders in @entity13 from the @entity51 military . fast facts : soldier on soldier attacks while the military has avoided labeling @entity3 a terrorist or charging him as such , prosecutors wanted to use the evidence to show that the devout @entity60 had undergone a \" progressive radicalization , \" going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings . @entity3 , who was scheduled to deploy to @entity13 , did not want to fight against other @entity60 and believed \" that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , \" lead prosecutor col. @entity68 has said . the judge , col. @entity69 , excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack , including e-mail communications between @entity3 and @entity75 , the @entity51 - born cleric who officials say became a key member of @entity78 . he was killed in @entity51 drone strike in 2011 . @entity69 ruled that the e-mails would have to be \" redacted to prevent undue prejudice by association \" and would diminish its use as evidence . she also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain show maj. @entity3 's interest in the actions of @entity90 sgt. @entity89 , the @entity51 soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the @entity14 war -- an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing @entity60 . \" the court believes sgt. @entity89 is not on trial in this case , \" @entity69 said . \" it would only open the door to a mini-trial \" and confuse the issue . @entity0 victims feel betrayed along with the e-mails and the material related to @entity89 , @entity69 also declined to allow the use of @entity3 's academic presentation on suicide bombings , saying \" motive is not an element of the crime . \" the judge did allow prosecutors to use evidence of @entity3 's internet searches on jihad and the @entity49 in the days and hours before the attack . just two hours before the shooting , a search of @entity3 's @entity124 netbook computer showed that someone had pulled up and read an article entitled \" @entity129 @entity49 chief urges @entity49 to fight @entity90 , \" @entity121 special agent @entity120 , a computer forensics examiner , testified . with the prosecution expected to rest as early as tuesday , the big question is whether @entity3 will take the stand . @entity3 , 42 , has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand . if he testifies , @entity3 is expected to discuss the religious justification for his actions . much has been made about @entity3 's defense or , as his stand - by attorneys have said , the lack of it , indicating he is perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence . @entity3 refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court - martial after the judge barred him from pleading guilty . under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases . the judge on monday raised again concerns about @entity3 acting as his own attorney after he admitted last week he did not understand that by listing someone as a witness he gave up the right of privileged communication with that person . \" remember when i told you that i thought you would be better off with a trained lawyer ? \" @entity69 asked . @entity3 responded : \" repeatedly . \" \" i 've advised you before and i 'm advising you again that it 's not a good policy to represent yourself . ... do you understand that ? \" @entity69 said . @entity3 said : \" yes , i do . \" military death row : more than 50 years and no executions last week , @entity3 released a portion of his mental health evaluation to the @entity168 . it revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr . \" i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life . however , if i died by lethal injection i would still be a martyr , \" @entity3 told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial , according to documents published by the @entity168 . @entity3 has been using a wheelchair since being shot by @entity0 police . he is paralyzed from the chest down . a @entity51 - born citizen of @entity184 descent , @entity3 was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the @entity90 in 1997 . but he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military , saying he had been taunted by people after the september 11 terror attacks that year . in 2006 , he inquired about the possibility of filing conscientious objector status . he did not go through with it , and the judge ruled that his inquiry could not be used by prosecutors to show motive ."
