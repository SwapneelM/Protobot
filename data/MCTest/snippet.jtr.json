The four of them got to work right  away. Fixing the toilet was easy. Fixing the door was also easy but fixing the window was  very hard. The window was stuck and could not be opened. They all pushed on the window  really hard until finally it opened. Once the window was fixed the four of them made a  delicious dinner and talked about all of the good work that they had done. Tom was glad  that he had such good friends to help him with his work."

She moved on the bed as he pulled her into his arms, \"Kate.\" He said into her ear, \"It's  time to wake up.\" He pressed a kiss to her head, and her eyes opened.    \"Hawthy?\" She said, her nickname for him moving from her lips.    \"Yea.\" He moved her hair.    \"I want to go outside today,\" she said, and he nodded in response.    \"If you are up to it, I won't stop you\", he told her, and she smiled.    \"Thanks Hawthy\", she said.

I opened the door and saw this  guy who had scar on his face. I asked my friend \"who is that guy?\", and he told me that it  was his friend. I didn't trust that guy because he looked very strange.    After we had dinner the strange guy asked my friend to come outside because he wanted to  talk to him. A few seconds later I heard a noise from outside and when I ran outside I saw  that the strange guy was trying to beat my friend. I ran towards him and asked him to  leave our house. He left the house but after half an hour he came back and this time he  was dressed up as superhero and he also had a sword. As soon as I saw him I ran inside the  house and called the cops. The cops came and the guy ran away as soon as he heard the cop  car coming. We never found out what happened to that guy after that day."

And then the other boy was named Alex, and he was handsome and cool. They were  opposites, but they didn't care. Alex would always protect James from the bullies because  James was weak.    One day, James was being teased by the bullies, Gordon and Johnny, but Alex wasn't there  to save him. James didn't know what to do and was scared. But then he remembered all of  the times Alex stood up for him. James looked up to Alex and he thought of him as his  hero. James wanted to protect himself and not have Alex always come to help. So this time,  James got up and was brave. He stood up to Gordon and Johnny and told them that he wasn't  scared. The bullies didn't know what to do and then gave up. They went away to look for  more fun things to do. Alex saw the whole thing and was proud of James for being brave.    Now James and Alex protect each other and stand up for each other. They still are the best  of friends."
