  FastQA configuration to train model on SQuAD as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04816.

# Reader model to use, see jack/readers/implementations.py for options
reader: 'fastqa_reader'

# fixed experiment seed
seed: 1337

# where to store the reader
save_dir: './fastqa_reader'

# 'lstm', 'gru', 'sru' (simple recurrent unit)
encoder: 'lstm'
with_char_embeddings: True

# 'conditional' (original fastqa, end score conditioned on predicted start), 'conditional_bilinear', 'bilinear'
# bilinear has shown best performance
answer_layer: bilinear
